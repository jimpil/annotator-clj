Antinociceptive and antiedematogenic effects of Tabebuia avellanedae Lor.
ex Griseb .
inner bark were measured by nociceptive experimental models in mice.
A rat paw edema test induced by carrageenan (1%) was also performed in rats to access the plant's antiedematogenic effect.
The inner bark aqueous extract, administered via oral in three different concentration, namely 100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg, reduced the nociception produced by <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> (0.6% in water, i.p.) by 49.9%, 63.7% and 43.8%, respectively.
The aqueous extract (200 and 400 mg/Kg, p.o.) reduced formalin (1%) effects only at the second phase of the experiment by 49.3% and 53.7%, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> (5 mg/Kg, i.p.) was not able to revert the extract effect, however <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) reverted its effect by 19.8% at the second phase of the formalin test.
The aqueous extract (200 mg/Kg, p.o.) inhibited edema by 12.9% when we used the rat paw edema model.
The acute toxicity was low in mice.
Conclusion
The T. avellanedae inner bark aqueous extract presented antinociceptive and antiedematogenic activities at the used models, with a possible antinociceptive effect associated to the <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> system.
Background
 Tabebuia avellanedae is a tree from the Bignoniaceae family.
Commonly know as "pau d'arco" in Brazil, its inner bark is used as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antineoplasic [ 1 , 2 ] and diuretic at the Brazilian northeast.
Its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antineoplasic activities are cited in the literature as promoted by saponines, flavonoides, cumarines, and natural antibiotics, such as the lapachol and its derivatives encountered on its constituents [ 3 - 6 ].
The antifungal activity of aqueous, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from T. avellanedae and other 13 Paraguayan plants were accessed by Portillo et al .
[ 7 ].
The aqueous and methanol extracts of T. avellanedae showed the highest antifungal activity.
Phytochemical studies revealed the presence of naphthoquinones, anthraquinones and quinoid compounds in T. avellanedae , although lapachol, previously cited as anti-inflammatory [ 8 ], was not detected in its aqueous extract [ 9 ].
Since T. avellanedae inner bark is extensively used as analgesic in Brazil, the goal of our work was to describe the antiedematogenic and antinociceptive effects and acute toxicity of T. avellanedae inner bark aqueous extract on various animal models.
Results
The inhibition of rat paw edema induced by carrageenan was significantly different between all groups (ANOVA: F 0.05;3;140 = 45.72; p < 0.0005) and time intervals tested (ANOVA: F 0.05;4;140 = 35.66; p < 0.0005) The volume variation was not proportional between all groups (ANOVA: F 0.05;12;140 = 1.94; p < 0.05).
The T. avellanedae aqueous extract inhibited edema only at the 200 mg/Kg dose (Tukey: q 0.05;140;4 = 5.02; p < 0.05, Table 1 ).
This test is used to evaluate anti-inflammatory drugs and has been used to test the antiedematogenic effect of various substances [ 10 ].
When performing an writhing test, results showed notable differences at the writhing frequency between all tested groups (Kruskal-Wallis: F 0.05;5;47 = 9.26; p < 0.0005).
T. avellanedae (100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg, p.o.) reduced the <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> effect (Nemenyi: q 0.05;∞;6 = 4.28, p < 0.05 and q 0.05;∞;6 = 4.17, p < 0.05, respectively, Table 2 ).
The abdominal constriction response is an unspecific nociception model used to evaluate the central and peripheral analgesics drug activities [ 11 ].
Our experiments showed significant differences between four groups when the reaction time was taken into account at the formalin 1% test during the first and second phases (Kruskal-Wallis: F 0.05;4;34 = 22.52; p < 0.0005 and F 0.05;4;34 = 23.45; p < 0.0005, respectivelly).
The aqueous extract of T. avellanedae (200 e 400 mg/Kg) reduced the formalin effect only at the second phase (Nemenyi: q 0,05;∞;5 = 4.264, p < 0.05 and q 0,05;∞;5 = 4.643, p < 0.05, Table 3 ).
 <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> (5 mg/Kg, i.p.) did not revert the action of the aqueous extract (400 mg/Kg) (Nemenyi: q 0.05;∞;3 = 4.27; p < 0.05).
 <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , an <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> A 1 and A 2 receptors antagonist, reverted the T. avellanedae aqueous extract action at the formalin test second phase (Nemenyi: q 0.05;∞;3 = 1.45; p > 0.05, Table 3 ).
There was no LD 50 when using doses up to 5000 mg/Kg.
Discussion
The aqueous extract at 200 mg/Kg inhibited the rat paw edema induced by carrageenan in a similar way as <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> (Table 1 ).
However at 400 mg/Kg we did not detect edema reduction.
It would be expected a dose-dependent effect when using higher concentrations.
Since the aqueous extract contains several compounds, another compound in the extract may be acting simultaneously to revert its own action.
Although the abdominal writhes induced by <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> represent a peripheral nociception model [ 12 ], this is not a specific model, since several compounds, such as, tricyclic antidepressants [ 13 ] and anti-histaminic [ 14 ] inhibit the writhes induce by <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> .
Even though the T. avellanedae AE prevented the writhes, there is still the need for studies using other analgesia models.
Three distinct phases are involved on the acute vascular response.
At the first phase simultaneous release of histamine and serotonin occurs.
At the second phase kinin release, such as bradykinin, occurs and at the terminal phase prostaglandins release occurs [ 15 ].
Any substance inhibiting the carrageenan action at the used model is considered as having anti-inflammatory action.
Since the effect of the AE was not reverted by <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> at the formalin test second phase, our studies indicate that the opioid system does not participate at the AE (200 and 400 mg/Kg) pharmacological properties.
On the other hand <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> reverted the AE action at the formalin test second phase, suggesting the participation of the <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> system at the analgesic effect.
 <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> may interact with at least four subtipes of receptors coupled with protein G, namely A 1 , A 2a , A 2b , and A 3 [ 16 ].
There has been evidences that activation of the A 1 and A 2 receptors produce an antinociceptive effect, while activation of the A 3 receptor produce nociception [ 17 ].
These facts are supported by experiments where <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> produced antinociception [ 16 ].
Henceforth the AE antinociceptive effect at the formalin test second phase may be associated to an activation of the A 1 and/or A 2 <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> receptors.
Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
The formalin test is one of the most used models to explain pain and analgesia mechanisms, with better results than the ones using mechanical or thermal stimulus [ 18 ].
This model is constituted by two distinct phases.
The first phase represents the irritating effect of formalin at the sensorial fibers-C.
The second is an inflammatory pain response.
Central acting analgesics, such as <START:DRUG> morphine <END> , inhibit both phases.
Peripheral acting drugs, such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory and corticosteroids, inhibit only the second phase [ 19 ].
It was not possible to measure the plant LD 50 due to the lack of mice deaths even at high concentration of the T. avellanedae aqueous extract.
This result indicates that the plant has a low toxicity profile [ 20 ].
The plant presented antiedematogenic and antinociceptive at the peripheral system, probably due to its action at mediators, such as bradykinin and prostaglandins at the neuron termination.
Hiperalgesy may also be involved on this process, mediated by the <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> A 2 receptor [ 21 , 22 ].
Conclusion
 Tabebuia avellanedae is used by popular medicine as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antineoplasic, and diuretic.
The T. avellanedae inner bark aqueous extract presented antinociceptive and antiedematogenic activities at the used models, with the antinociceptive effect associated to the <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> system.
These results validate the plant popular use as analgesic and antiinflammatory.
The antimicrobial, antineoplasic, and diuretic activities were not studied.
Materials and Methods
Plant material
The Tabebuia avellanedae inner bark collected at the "Capim Grosso" village (Canindé do São Francisco region) was used.
The plant identification was made on site by our herbalist (Gilvane V. Souza, Biology Department) and a voucher specimen number 2955 was deposited at the University of Sergipe herbarium, (Universidade Federal de Sergipe, CCBS, Departamento de Biologia, São Cristovão, Sergipe, 49100–000, Brazil).
Aqueous extract preparation
The plant inner barks were dried at 40°C in oven and triturated using a mill in order to obtain a powder.
Distilled water (1:10 w/v) at 100°C was added to the triturated powder, constituting the aqueous extract.
The extract was infused for 30 min, filtered, lyophilized and used on the pharmacological tests.
The yield of the aqueous extract was 8.9% w/w.
In order to perform all experiments the extract was reconstituted in enough water to make a 100 mg/mL solution and administered p.o.
60 minutes before the experiment.
Animals
Swiss mice (20–35 g) and Wistar rats (120–200 g) male and female were used as test animals.
The animals were maintained in plastic boxes, with food and water ad libitum .
The animals submitted to oral administration of the extract or drugs were fasted for 12 hours.
Drugs preparation
Drugs used in the experiments were diluted in a way to obtain a injection volume of 0.1 mL/10 g (animal weight), except when defined in the text.
Each drug was dissolved in appropriate solvents as follows: <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> (Sigma), diluted in water/0.1 N NaOH (pH = 8); carrageenan 1% (Sigma), in saline solution; <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> 0.6% (Merck), in water; <START:DRUG> morphine <END> hydrochloride (Sigma) in water; formalin 1% (Baker) in water; <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> hydrochloride (Sigma), in water; <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (Sigma) in water.
Acute toxicity (LD 50 )
In order to verify the plant LD 50 , mice (n = 10) received the aqueous extract (1, 3 and 5 g/Kg; p.o.).
The mortality index was observed during 48 hours [ 20 ].
Rat paw edema test
The antiedematogenic activity was evaluated by the rat paw edema test[ 10 ] (n = 8) induced by carrageenan at 1% in.
 <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> (10 mg/Kg; p.o.) and the T. avellanedae aqueous extract (200 and 400 mg/Kg; p.o.) were administered 1 h before the flogistic agent subplantar injection.
The control group received only the carrageenan injection.
The paw volume was measured at the time 0, then measured again 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the carrageenan administration by the water displacement method measured with the help of a plethysmometer (model 7150, Ugo Basile).
Writhing test
The antinociceptive effect was evaluated by the writhing test [ 11 ] in mice (n = 9), induced by <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> 0.6% (0.1 mL/10 g; i.p.).
The T. avellanedae aqueous extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg; p.o.) was administered 1 h before the nociceptive agent.
Ten minutes after the acid administration we observed the number of writhes for a period of 20 min.
 <START:DRUG> morphine <END> (2.5 mg/Kg, i.p.) and <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> (10 mg/Kg, p.o.) were used as test standards.
Formalin test
The antinociceptive effect was also evaluated by the formalin test.
It was observed the time (seconds), which each mice (n = 8) spent licking its posterior left paw after administration, subplantar route, of formalin 0.02 mL, 1% [ 19 , 23 ].
The T. avellanedae aqueous extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg; p.o.) was administered 1 h before the formalin injection.
The standard test drug was <START:DRUG> morphine <END> (7.5 mg/Kg, i.p.).
The reaction time to pain was measured during 0–5 min and 20–25 min after the stimulus.
In order to verify a possible opioid system participation, <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> (5 mg/Kg; i.p.) was administered with the AE to another animal group (n = 8, Table 3 ).
In a similar way <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (10 mg/Kg; i.p.) was administered with the AE to verify possible <START:DRUG> adenosine <END> system receptor participation.
 <START:DRUG> morphine <END> and <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> were also administered to another animal group.
Statistical analysis
The inflammation test results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Tukey test.
In order to analyze the nociception model we used the non-parametrical analogous test, the Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Nemenyi test, with a significance level of 5%.
Inhibition percents were calculated by the formula: Inhibition percent = (1 -Vt/Vc)×100, where Vt and Vc represent the average paw volume, the number of writhes, or the licking paw time of the treated and control groups, respectively.
The effect of GABA receptor ligands in experimental spina bifida occulta
Background
The pathophysiology behind spina bifida and other neural tube defects (NTDs) is unclear.
 <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> is one variable, but other factors remain.
Studies suggest that substances active at the GABA receptor may produce NTDs.
To test this hypothesis pregnant rats were exposed to either the GABA a agonist muscimol (1, 2 or 4 mg/kg), the GABA a antagonist bicuculline (.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg), the GABA b agonist <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> (15, 30, 60 mg/kg), or the GABA b antagonist hydroxysaclofen (1, 3, or 5 mg/kg) during neural tube formation.
Normal saline was used as a control and <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> (600 mg/kg) as a positive control.
The embryos were analyzed for the presence of a spina bifida like NTD.
Results
After drug administration the pregnancies were allowed to proceed to the 21 st day of gestation.
Then embryos were removed and skeletons staining and cleared.
Vertebral arch closure was measured.
Results indicate that the GABAa receptor agonist muscimol, the GABAa receptor antagonist bicuculline, and the GABAb agonist <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> produced NTDs characterized by widening of the vertebral arch.
Oppositely the GABAb antagonist hydroxysaclofen produced narrowing of the vertebral arches.
Conclusions
The findings indicate that GABA a or b ligands are capable of altering neural formation.
GABA may play a greater than appreciated role in neural tube formation and may be important in NTDs.
The narrowing of the vertebral arch produced by the GABA b antagonist hydroxysalcofen suggests that GABA b receptor may play an undefined role in neural tube closure that differs from the GABA a receptor.
Background
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are major malformations of the central nervous system (CNS) due to a defect in the covering of the CNS.
They are among the most prevalent of congenital malformations.
NTDs are second only to congenital heart defects as a cause of perinatal mortality due to birth defect and range in incidence from 0.5 to 12 per 1000 live births, depending on the country, accounting for 400,000 births world-wide annually.
Factors that predispose individuals to NTDs are numerous.
While <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> deficiency and altered <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> metabolism have received widespread attention, other contributors are also important.
Socio-economic status, genetic factors, maternal illness and maternal drug exposure are important contributors to the risk of NTDs.
Drug models of NTDs are valued because the drug's action provides a possible explanation of the pathophysiology of NTDs.
 <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END>  (VA) is a well-known teratogen in both animals and humans, with a 5-fold occurrence of spina bifida (SB) in pregnant women exposed to the drug [ 1 ].
The mechanism by which VA produces SB is unknown but inhibition of <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> metabolism is one hypothesis [ 2 , 3 ].
Some investigators have brought the <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> hypothesis into question by demonstrating that <START:DRUG> folic acid <END> supplementation has no effect on VA exposed embryos in-vitro [ 4 , 5 ].
These studies suggest that another mechanism may be responsible for the production of SB by VA.
Other possible mechanisms include alteration of neuronal membrane conductance, sodium channel blockade or altered neuronal <START:DRUG> calcium <END> metabolism [ 6 ].
VA is also known to allow GABA, the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter of the CNS, to accumulate in tissues.
The role of GABA as a potential site for teratogen activity for VA and other teratogens has been little explored.
Preliminary reports have linked ligands active at the GABA receptor with SB or other NTDs, including benzodiazepines, alcohol, and <START:DRUG> zinc <END> [ 7 - 11 ].
Preliminary work from this laboratory has shown the GABAa receptor agonist muscimol and the GABAb agonist <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> produce both SB and the Arnold-Chiari malformation, commonly associated with SB [ 12 - 14 ].
VA appears to produce most of its anticonvulsant effects by increasing levels of GABA in the CNS, presumably by inhibiting the enzyme GABA-transaminase (GABA-T).
There is other evidence to suggest that substances which alter the function of the GABAergic system may contribute to the formation of NTDs.
Alcohol has been associated with NTDs [ 11 ] and is known to enhance the functioning of GABA.
Benzodiazepines (BDZs), which enhance the activity of the GABA receptor, also enhance the teratogenic effects of VA in humans [ 10 ].
 <START:DRUG> chlordiazepoxide <END> , another BDZ, has been shown to produce NTDs in the hamster [ 11 ].
Further support for the contention that VA may produce NTDs by way of GABA activity include the following evidence.
One hypothesis of VAs mechanism of action holds that it alters intracelluar pH.
This may be the case as GABA can increase intracellular proton levels by intensifying bicarbonate ion conductance through a GABA-gated channel [ 15 ] which may act as a "developmental handshake" and regulate neuronal differentiation [ 16 ].
The chloride channel, an integral part of the GABA a receptor, has been implicated in embryonic development [ 17 ].
GABA receptors are first seen at the time the neural tube formation [ 18 ].
Binding sites to GABA agonists and antagonists and the expression of GABA receptor mRNAs are seen starting at 4 days of development and peak at 10–15 days, corresponding to the time of neural tube formation [ 19 ].
Many neurotransmitters, including GABA, are growth factor candidates for the CNS [ 20 - 22 ].
Based on the above information we have undertaken this study to systematically examine the effects of GABA agonists and antagonists at both the GABA a and b receptor and the role they may play in SB.
We used an established model of SB in the rat to test the hypothesis using VA as a known standard.
This model of SB uses the width of the vertebral arch as an indicator of neural tube closure.
While this model does not produce a specific SB lesion the widening of the vertebral arch provides a model that resembles human SB in terms of accompanying defects [ 12 - 14 , 23 ] and response to folate and other drugs [ 6 , 11 , 24 , 25 ] and meets the formal definition of a neural tube defect: any defect in the covering of the central nervous system.
We report here the effects of GABA a and b receptor agonists and antagonists administered to rats at 10 days gestation, the period of neural tube formation.
Results and Discussion
A total of 1156 embryos from 123 litters were examined.
Measurements from the embryos were averaged for each litter and the litter was used as the unit of analysis.
All measurements were made in a blind manner.
ANOVA revealed a significant effect of drug treatment of the average vertebral arch distance (F(13, 109)=7.70, p < .0001).
The Bonferroni test was used for follow-up comparisons and the comparisons to the normal saline group are given below and in Table 1 and in Figure 1 where the results are presented graphically.
Occasionally other defects were noted in the embryos, chiefly fused ribs, these defects were not appreciable and did not impact the vertebral arch analysis.
There is no statistically significant relationship between mean vertebral arch distance and mean littler size.

See text for comments.
 <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> produced a significant widening of the vertebral arch in a manner consistent with previous reports (p < .0005) [ 6 , 24 ]
The GABAa agonist muscimol produced a significant widening of the vertebral arch at all three doses tested (1, 2, 4 mg/kg) (p=.06 for 1 mg/kg, p < .05 for 2 & 4 mg/kg).
The GABAa antagonist bicuculline also widened vertebral arch distance at the 0.5 and 1 mg/kg doses (p < .05), but not at the 2 mg/kg dose.
The GABAb agonist <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> produced significant widening of the vertebral arch at 30 mg/kg (p < .05) but not at 15 or 60 mg/kg.
The GABAb antagonist hydroxysaclofen produced a significant narrowing of the vertebral arch at all three doses tested (p=.09 for 1 mg/kg, p=.001 for 3 mg/kg and p=.05 for 5 mg/kg).
This study indicates that substances active at either the GABA a or b receptors have teratogenic potential.
The most striking feature of the drug effects is the differential effect of antagonizing the GABAb receptor with hydroxysaclofen.
While the GABAa agonist muscimol and antagonist bicucullin widened the vertebral arch, as did the GABAb agonist <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> , the GABAb antagonist hydroxysaclofen narrowed the vertebral arch.
Narrowing of the vertebral arch was unexpected but has been previously reported.
Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated narrowing of the vertebral arch when <START:DRUG> zinc <END> is co-administered with <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> or muscimol [ 13 ].
It is unclear what the structural or functional consequence of vertebral arch narrowing is.
Work in this laboratory has shown lags in neuromuscular development associated with excessive <START:DRUG> zinc <END> exposure during neural tube formation and, possibly, accompanying narrowing of the vertebral arches [ 26 ].
Another curious finding of this study is that widening of the vertebral arch occurs with either the GABAa agonist muscimol or the antagonist bicuculline.
In classic pharmacology it would be expected that the effects would be opposite.
However, in this instance it may be that any disruption of the normal function of the GABAa receptor and its integral chloride channel result in widening of the vertebral arch.
On the other hand the GABAb receptor is not directly linked to a chloride channel exerting its effect via second messenger systems.
This functional difference may allow for a classic agonist-antagonist drug effect during neural tube formation.
One potential confound of this study is the role of developmental delays.
Animals exposed to valproate and presumably suffering from widened vertebral arches can show weight differences well into post-natal life.
However, behavioral differences persist even when weight differences no longer exist [ 1 ].
However, we are unaware of any studies directly examining the spinal columns of animals well into post-natal life, therefore it is unclear if the widening of the vertebral arch seen at 21 days persists.
Another limitation to this study is the small sample sizes for some groups and the administration of drugs to only one day.
These results need to be replicated using larger sample sizes and administering the drugs at other times during gestation.
It is possible that these drugs may disrupt neural tube formation if given outside of the classic time frame for neural tube formation.
GABA is a well-documented neurotrophic agent involved in brain development [ 27 - 30 ].
Most of the work done on the effects of GABA and neural development has been done on embryos and embryonic tissue well past the neural tube stage [ 27 , 31 , 32 ].
However, there is evidence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA receptor expression about the time of neural tube formation [ 27 ].
Given that GABA is important to neural development, and the early developmental time frame of the GABA system, it is logical that agents active at the GABA receptor ( <START:DRUG> ethanol <END> , BDZs) can have adverse consequences on CNS development.
Nearly all of the substances examined are GABAa receptor ligands.
GABAb receptor effects have been little studied and the role of the GABAb receptor in neural development is little known and should be more thoroughly investigated.
Conclusions
GABA may play an important role in neural tube formation and the production of neural tube defects.
Substances active at the GABA a or b receptor may be potentially teratogenic.
In particular, the findings indicate that GABA a or b ligands are capable of altering neural formation.
GABA may play a greater than appreciated role in neural tube formation and may be important in neural tube defects.
The narrowing of the vertebral arch produced by the GABA b antagonist hydroxysalcofen suggests that GABA b receptor may play an important, but undefined role in neural tube closure that differs from the GABA a receptor.
Materials and Methods
Female Long-Evans rats 120 days of age were housed with ad-lib access to food and rat chow (Purina, Brentwood, MO) under 12:12 light:dark conditions.
The females were mated with males of the same age and strain overnight with the observation of a copulatory plug as evidence of mating and counted as day 0 of pregnancy.
The females were then separated and housed singly.
At 10 days of gestation the females were treated with one drug as described below.
Ten days of gestation corresponds with neural tube formation in the rat.
All drugs and chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical, St, Louis, MO.
Doses were empirically determined with pilot studies.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Nebraska at Kearney.
Reference groups
Normal saline intraperitoneally (IP) 0.9 cc to establish baseline.
 <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> subcutaneously (SC) 1200 mg/kg (600 mg/cc) in two divided doses over 8 hours.
Previous studies have shown this dose and route to reliably produce SB in the rat [ 24 ].
This group provided a positive control to which the teratogenic activity of other substances could be compared.
GABAa test groups
Muscimol IP at 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg (1 mg/cc).
Muscimol is a well-documented specific and potent GABAa agonist [ 33 ].
Bicuculline methiodide IP at 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg (1 mg/cc).
Bicuculline is a well-documented specific and potent GABAa antagonist [ 33 ].
GABAb test groups
 <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> IP at 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg (9 mg/cc as aqueous suspension).
 <START:DRUG> baclofen <END> is a well-documented and specific GABAb agonist [ 34 ].
Hydroxysaclofen IP at 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg (1 mg/cc).
Hydroxysaclofen is a well-documented specific and potent GABAb antagonist [ 34 ].
Embryo studies
After injection gestation was allowed to otherwise progress as normal.
At 21 days gestation the females were euthenized with chloroform, the abdomen opened and the uterus and uterine contents removed.
Fetuses were removed and had their abdomens opened to allow for the penetration of 10% 0.1 M phosphate buffered formalin in which they were immersed.
After three days fixation the fetuses were stained for bone and cartilage as described previously [ 24 ].
Briefly, the fetuses were eviscerated and skinned.
Cartilage was stained with alcian blue followed by bone staining with alizarin red.
The fetuses were cleared in KOH and graded concentrations of <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> .
After clearing the fetuses were inspected with a dissecting microscope and the width of the vertebral arch gap was measured with an eyepiece micrometer from T-9 to S-4.
Previous work has shown that these vertebrae are the most clearly visible and the most frequently effected [ 6 , 24 ].
For the sake of clarity vertebral arch distances from T-9 to S-4 were averaged for the each embryo.
For analysis vertebral arch distance was averaged for each fetus and then for the litter.
Data was analyzed with Analysis of Variance with follow-up statistics (Bonferroni test) using Statview 5.0 for the Macintosh.
Reporting of adverse drug reactions in randomised controlled trials – a systematic survey
Background
Decisions on treatment are guided, not only by the potential for benefit, but also by the nature and severity of adverse drug reactions.
However, some researchers have found numerous deficiencies in trial reports of adverse effects.
We sought to confirm these findings by evaluating trials of drug therapy published in seven eminent medical journals in 1997.
Methods
Literature review to determine whether the definition, recording and reporting of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials were in accordance with published recommendations on structured reporting.
Results
Of the 185 trials reviewed, 25 (14%) made no mention of adverse drug reactions.
Data in a further 60 (32%) could not be fully evaluated, either because numbers were not given for each treatment arm (31 trials), or because a generic statement was made without full details (29 trials).
When adverse drug reactions such as clinical events or patient symptoms were mentioned in the reports, details on how they had been recorded were given in only 14/95 (15%) and 18/104 (17%) trials respectively.
Of the 86 trials that mentioned severity of adverse drug reactions, only 42 (49%) stated how severity had been defined.
The median amount of space used for safety data in the Results and Discussion sections was 5.8%.
Conclusions
Trial reports often failed to provide details on how adverse drug reactions were defined or recorded.
The absence of such methodological information makes comparative evaluation of adverse reaction rates potentially unreliable.
Authors and journals should adopt recommendations on the structured reporting of adverse effects.
Background
Although drug safety information is of vital importance, evidence is now emerging that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are often inadequately reported in randomised, controlled trials [ 1 , 2 ].
Lack of consistency in ADR reporting has important implications – it makes systematic reviews of ADR data extremely difficult and also hinders comparisons of ADR rates between trials.
For example, the authors of a recent systematic review of beta-blockers in myocardial infarction were able to draw conclusions on the efficacy of treatment, but not safety, because "different definitions and reporting made comparisons between trials problematic" [ 3 ].
Two aspects of reporting are particularly important when comparing rates of ADRs in different trials [ 4 ].
Firstly, adverse event recording in trials may frequently include unfavourable outcomes that arise from disease progression or concomitant co-morbidity, and are unrelated to drug treatment.
Trial reports of adverse events need to make it clear which ones are thought to be ADRs.
Secondly, different methods of recording ADRs can lead to significantly different results.
For example, Olsen et al's study of hypertensive patients showed that rates of ADRs varied depending on whether spontaneous reporting, general enquiry, or specific questioning had been used in detecting ADRs (rates of 16%, 24%, and 62% respectively) [ 5 ].
ADR data can be reliably interpreted only when there is information on how they were recorded.
Although the original CONSORT statement made no mention of adverse effects, the recent revised statement recommends only that "all important adverse events or side effects [are reported] in each intervention group" [ 6 ].
More detailed recommendations on the structured reporting of ADRs were made by the SORT committee in 1994 [ 7 ].
Trials should:
• define what constituted adverse events and how they were monitored by the intervention group;
• present sufficient simple (unadjusted) summary data on primary outcome measures and important adverse effects for the reader to reproduce the result.
We carried out our study to determine if the reporting of ADRs in a wide selection of randomised controlled trials was in accordance with these recommendations.
Methods
Selection of trials
We used a sample of randomised controlled trials that had been published in seven general medical journals: The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, The British Medical Journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine, and The American Journal of Medicine.
We selected these journals because they are highly ranked in the Science Citation Index and provide a relatively broad coverage of general medical topics.
The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was used to identify all the randomised controlled trials from these journals in the year 1997 [ 8 ].
As our primary objective was to evaluate the reporting of drug ADRs, we reviewed only those trials in which at least one treatment arm involved a pharmacological intervention.
We excluded papers in which the main bulk of the data had been published elsewhere, e.g. post hoc or subgroup analyses of trials, or papers that stated that adverse effects data were or would be available in a separate publication.
A complete list of the trials evaluated is available from the authors.
Two reviewers assessed all trials independently, using a checklist, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
Evaluation
The review checklist was based largely on the recommendations of SORT; our main criteria were that:
1.
ADRs should be clearly and appropriately defined;
2.
there should be sufficient detail on how the reported ADRs were elicited and recorded (including definitions of severity) so that the reader can fully interpret the result or reproduce the study if necessary;
3.
frequencies of adverse effects should be reported in a simple, coherent manner.
We also measured the amount of space (area in cm 2 ) in the Results and Discussion sections that was devoted to ADR reports.
Details are given below on the specific criteria used in evaluating ADR reports.
Clear and appropriate use of ADR definitions
Adverse drug reactions have been defined as those "where the causal relation between the product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility", while the less specific (but widely used) term "adverse events" should be reserved for describing untoward occurrences that are not necessarily causally related to the treatment [ 9 , 10 ].
The terms should not be used interchangeably.
The use of terminology was considered appropriate if trials reported drug safety with terms such as "adverse drug reactions", "adverse or side effects" or "drug toxicity", or if they explicitly stated which adverse events were possibly related to drug treatment.
Reports of adverse outcomes without clarification of their relation to drug treatment were considered to be inadequate.
Sufficient detail on methods used in monitoring of ADRs for the reader to interpret or reproduce the result
When ADRs were reported, we asked whether it was possible for readers to tell which specific methods had been used in the detection or recording of ADRs.
We evaluated the following areas of ADR monitoring – symptoms reported by patients, events diagnosed clinically by physicians, and abnormalities detected using investigative tests.
Patients' symptoms
We asked whether the trial report explained how the rates of symptomatic ADRs had been determined during the course of the study; for example, by spontaneous reporting, patient diary or checklist questionnaire.
ADRs presenting as clinical events diagnosed by physicians
We asked whether the reported ADRs had been detected with specific, targeted clinical assessments or purely from spontaneous reports as they arose.
In particular, we looked for detail of systematic surveillance measures e.g. investigators were asked to take blood pressure readings at 15 minute intervals to look for hypotension; rates of gastrointestinal haemorrhages were monitored through routine checking of hospital records.
ADRs detected through the use of diagnostic tests
We asked whether the trial specified which diagnostic techniques had been used in detecting the reported ADRs; for example, was deep venous thrombosis diagnosed by ultrasonography or by contrast venography?
In cases in which laboratory tests were used, we asked whether the laboratory values or criteria for diagnosing an abnormality were stated; for example, was hypokalaemia diagnosed at serum <START:DRUG> potassium <END> concentrations below 3.0 mmol/l?
Severity
We looked for details on the severity of the reported ADRs and, if present, whether the measures of severity were made according to recognized scales (such as the National Cancer Institute Toxicity Grades[ 11 ]), or otherwise defined e.g. " major bleeds were those that were fatal or required transfusion".
Nature of ADR reporting
Numerical data
When ADRs were reported, we asked whether simple summary (unadjusted) data were always given for each treatment arm; were there instances in which data were given as a lumped total (e.g. headache noted in 5% of all patients in the trial), or for only one treatment arm?
We also looked at the prevalence of statements that could not be fully interpreted owing to lack of detail on the frequency and/or type of adverse effect; e.g. "The pattern and profile of adverse effects were similar" or "The treatments were well tolerated".
Such generic statements, in the absence of any supporting information, are not helpful in evaluating the frequency of ADRs [ 2 ].
Space for reporting adverse events
We measured the area (cm 2 ) used for reporting ADRs (text, figures and tables) in the Results and Discussion sections of the published paper, and expressed it as a percentage of the total area of the Results and Discussion sections.
Results
Of the 185 eligible trials, 25 (13.5%) made no mention of adverse effects in any part of the paper and were therefore not analysed further.
Definition of ADRs
We found 48 trials out of 160 (30%) in which it was not clear which (if any) of the reported adverse events were considered to be drug-related.
For instance, in a study of <START:DRUG> captopril <END> for heart failure, cough (a well-recognised ADR of <START:DRUG> captopril <END> ) was listed together with other untoward incidents, such as myocardial infarction, in a table of adverse events [ 12 ].
Systematic reviewers and members of the public who are unfamiliar with pharmacology may end up erroneously believing that myocardial infarction is a harmful drug-related effect of <START:DRUG> captopril <END> , when in fact, myocardial infarction is a recognised complication of the underlying illness.
Monitoring of ADRs
Details of the methods used in ascertaining the rate of ADRs were more likely to be given when an investigative test was required for diagnosis of the ADR (Table 1 ).
In contrast, many trials merely said that patients were routinely assessed for the presence of ADRs such as clinical events, or new symptoms.
It was usually unclear whether this involved targeted clinical assessments for particular ADRs, or if it was left to the patients to report any untoward events.
Grade of severity
Of the 86 trials that commented on the severity of the reported ADRs, more than half (44 trials, 51%) did not give details on how severity was defined or which, if any, recognized severity grading system was used.
Reporting
Numerical data
Of the 160 trials that mentioned ADRs, analysis of the full dataset was not possible in 60 (38%) trials.
Nineteen gave figures on ADRs for one treatment arm only (without details of figures for the other arms) and 12 provided lumped totals without specifying the numbers that occurred in individual arms.
Information on ADRs in a further 29 trials could not be fully analysed because it was based on generic statements without adequate definition or supporting numerical data.
A summary of the findings is shown in Figure 1 .
Reporting of adverse drug reactions – flow chart summary of results.
Proportion of space for reporting adverse effects in the Results and Discussion section
The median proportion of space devoted to ADR reporting in the Results and Discussion section was 5.8%, and the mean was 8.2% (interquartile range of 1.7–12%).
Discussion
"Readers should not have to infer what was probably done, they should be told explicitly" wrote Altman in support of the recommendations on better reporting of randomised controlled trials [ 13 ].
Disappointingly, in this series of trials it was often not possible to tell what had been done to define or detect the reported ADRs.
Most authors were content either to say that adverse effects were assessed routinely (leaving the reader to infer the exact methods), or gave no information at all, ignoring the SORT recommendation that sufficient detail should be given for readers to reproduce the results.
This leaves us in a quandary when we try to interpret rates of ADRs.
Perceived differences in drug safety profiles may result simply from the use of different methods, rather than reflecting any genuine disparity.
For example, trials that found relatively high rates of ADRs may have done so because patients' diaries, rather than spontaneous reporting, were used in monitoring ADRs [ 1 ].
A similar lack of information on the criteria (or grading system) used in gauging the severity of ADRs makes it difficult to assess their clinical impact.
There will be differences in the reported rate, and clinical significance, of an ADR such as hypokalaemia if it was diagnosed at plasma <START:DRUG> potassium <END> concentrations below 3.0 mmol/l in one trial, and at levels below 3.5 mmol/l in another.
As these methodological details are seldom fully described in trial reports, any comparative evaluation of ADR rates between trials should be viewed as being potentially unreliable.
Although deviations from a precise definition of the term "ADR" may seem to be a minor issue, closer analysis reveals how misleading conclusions may result from the inappropriate use of terminology.
A systematic review of postoperative analgesia found <START:DRUG> piroxicam <END> to have a significantly better safety profile than placebo [ 14 ].
However, on closer examination, we found that symptoms such as fever and headache were recorded as adverse effects in the <START:DRUG> piroxicam <END> trials.
 <START:DRUG> piroxicam <END> (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) is an effective treatment for fevers and headaches, and it is therefore no surprise that placebo turned out to have a greater rate of "adverse effects" and was considered less safe.
In order to avoid potential confusion, authors should provide sufficient information in adverse event reports for readers to be aware of which events were defined as ADRs, and which were considered to be adverse clinical events unrelated to therapy.
We recognise that trials may be insufficiently powered for detection of rare adverse effects and cannot be expected to detect and report all adverse effects associated with a drug.
We also do not mean to imply that trials providing long lists of ADRs are better than those that report few.
However, our primary concern is that adverse effects data, when available, should be reported in a consistent manner.
Specific steps for monitoring ADRs have already been laid down under the International Conference on Harmonisation – Good Clinical Practice guidelines for clinical trials, and it is regrettable that much of the information collected is not reported in a useful format [ 9 ].
Authors may argue that space constraints in journals prevent them from reporting ADRs in more detail.
However, we found that many papers used only a small proportion of space for reporting safety data – 68% of the reviewed trials devoted less than 10% of the total area in the Results and Discussion section to describing adverse effects.
Greater clarity in the reporting of ADRs could be achieved if authors were prepared to reduce the emphasis on efficacy and devote a greater proportion of space to safety.
In addition, journals that maintain a web presence could be asked to provide dedicated areas for the reporting of adverse effects data.
Systematic reviews summarising the effects of health care have recently been accused of bias, because they emphasise efficacy rather than safety [ 15 ].
However, the disparate nature of ADR reporting does not facilitate systematic analysis, and it is therefore no surprise that systematic reviews are unable to provide a balanced viewpoint.
Patients and their physicians will not be able to make accurate judgements on the benefit:harm ratio unless safety reporting receives equal attention.
Widespread adoption of the SORT recommendations on the reporting of adverse effects would substantially improve the quality of information without adding greatly to the burden of work for authors.
In summary, we believe that the absence of methodological detail, and lack of coherency in reporting the rates of ADRs creates significant problems for those trying to interpret the data.
Authors need to:
• specify the methods used in detecting ADRs (incidental reporting, routine recording, or active seeking)
• define ADRs, and the scale of severity used
• report the frequencies of ADRs for each treatment arm
Valuable evidence on ADRs will continue to be misinterpreted or lost unless these measures are adopted by authors and journal editors.
Conclusions
Trial reports often failed to provide details on how adverse drug reactions were defined or recorded.
The absence of such methodological details makes comparative evaluation of adverse effects rates between trials potentially unreliable, and hinders systematic review or meta-analysis of such data.
The quality of the information would be significantly improved if authors and journals adopted recommendations on structured reporting of adverse effects.

Omapatrilat normalizes renal function curve in spontaneously hypertensive rats
Background
The present study was designed to analyze the chronic renal response to omapatrilat, a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
To that end, the renal and blood pressure response to a 4-day salt loading protocol was analyzed and the respective chronic renal curves constructed.
Results
In non treated animals, and under normal sodium intake (around 2 mEq/day), mean arterial pressure (MAP), was significantly higher in the SHR as compared with the controls (WKY).
After increasing salt intake (8 times normal), MAP did not change significantly in any group and the animals reached a normal sodium balance in four days.
In a second group of animals, omapatrilat was given orally for 15 days at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day in the drinking water.
In these omapatrilat-treated animals, and under normal sodium intake, MAP was significantly lower in both groups, although the antihypertensive effect was much greater in the SHR, so that the MAP of the SHR group was completely normalized and similar to the WKY-treated group.
The subsequent elevation of sodium intake did not significantly elevate MAP in any group and the animals could manage the sodium excess as well as the non treated groups.
Conclusions
These results indicate that chronic treatment with omapatrilat normalizes blood pressure in SHR without affecting adversely the renal ability to eliminate a sodium load.
Chronic treatment with omapatrilat resets the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship of the SHR to a normal level, thus without altering the normal salt-independence of this arterial hypertension model.
Background
Vasopeptidase inhibitors, agents that inhibit both neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme, have recently emerged as a novel pharmacological tool for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases.
Omapatrilat, one of this new inhibitors, has been shown to be very effective as an antihypertensive agent.
In fact, different laboratories have shown that the omapatrilat antihypertensive effects are greater than those obtained with other commonly used antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) [ 1 ].
It is known that the mechanism of action of omapatrilat is double.
On one hand, it reduces the formation of angiotensin II.
On the other hand, it allows the accumulation of natriuretic factors, such as bradykinin.
Thus, omapatrilat affects both the vascular tone and renal function, and this has been documented in several forms of experimental hypertension [ 2 - 4 ].
However, the characterization of an antihypertensive drug such as omapatrilat can not be considered complete unless the pressure natriuresis relationship is determined.
It is known that a resetting of the pressure natriuresis mechanism is involved in the antihypertensive effect of many drugs [ 5 ].
Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure but also the slope of the pressure natriuresis relationship, thus making blood pressure sensitive to salt intake [ 6 , 7 ].
The presence of an additional direct natriuretic effect in the omapatrilat molecule may change the pressure natriuresis relationship in a different way as as with ACEIs.
Thus, in the present study we have examined the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship during the administration of omapatrilat in the SHR model of experimental hypertension.
Results
In the non treated animals and under normal sodium intake, mean arterial pressure (MAP, figure 1 ), was significantly higher in the SHR (165.
1 ± 1.8 mmHg) as compared with the controls (WKY, 124.5 ± 2.8).
After increasing salt intake (8 times normal), MAP did not change significantly in any group (161.8 ± 2.0 and 124.9 ± 3.6, respectively).
There were no significant differences in sodium balance while the animals were on a normal sodium intake.
After elevating sodium intake, these animals reached a normal sodium balance in four days (figure 2 ).

In a second group of animals, omapatrilat was given orally for 15 days at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day in the drinking water.
In these omapatrilat-treated animals, and under normal sodium intake, MAP was significantly lower in both groups (112.4 ± 2.7 and 112.7 ± 2.7, in SHR and WKY respectively), although the antihypertensive effect was much greater in the SHR, so that the MAP of the SHR group was completely normalized and similar to the WKY-treated group.
The subsequent elevation of sodium intake did not significantly elevate MAP in any group (118.1 ± 1.7 vs 113.9 ± 2.7, respectively, figure 1 ).
These omapatrilat-treated animals could also manage the sodium excess as well as the non treated groups (figure 2 ).
There were no important changes in renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Under normal sodium intake, the GFR of the WKY group was 1.7 ± 0.1 ml/min/gkw and 1.6 ± 0.1 in the SHR.
The elevation of sodium did not change significantly GFR in any group.
Pretreatment with omapatrilat did not produce statistical differences between groups (1.5 ± 0.1 in WKY and 1.7 ± 0.1 in the SHR) under the normal sodium intake and the increase of sodium intake also was without an effect.
Discussion
In the present study we have characterized the antihypertensive effect of omapatrilat in the spontaneous arterial hypertensive rat model by analyzing the renal and blood response response to an elevation of salt intake.
The characterization of the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship allows a precise estimation of the kidney-fluid mechanism that controls arterial pressure, as stated by Guyton and coworkers in a very elegant series of experiments [ 8 ].
As opposed to the acute pressure natriuresis relationship, which has to be performed in anesthetized animals by changing the renal perfusion pressure [ 9 , 10 ], the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship characterized in the present report is obtained in undisturbed animals by changing the intake of salt and water.
In any case, however, both approaches should give the same estimate of the so-called equilibrium point at which blood pressure is set for any intake of sodium and water.
This equilibrium point, also called set-point, is therefore the blood pressure that will be reached in the long-term, in any physiological or pathological situation [ 5 , 6 ].
The results contained in this manuscript clearly show, as in other previous studies, that omapatrilat is a very potent antihypertensive effect.
In fact, it has been reported that omapatrilat appears to have even greater antihypertensive effects in SHR than ACEIs alone [ 1 ].
In our hands, blood pressure was normalized by the chronic treatment with omapatrilat, while in other studies using only an ACEI such as enapatrilat, blood pressure remained slightly above the normal values [ 11 ].
The mechanisms behind this beneficial effect of omapatrilat may be double.
Both the decrease in the formation of angiotensin II and the accumulation of natriuretic peptides should, at least theoretically, contribute to the decrease in blood pressure, through both a vasodilatory action and the elimination of more salt and water.
Although the blood pressure lowering effect of vasopeptidase inhibitors has been shown by many different laboratories, its effects on renal function have not been characterized.
Our results clearly demonstrate that omapatrilat does not negatively affect the renal function of the hypertensive animals.
Thus, glomerular filtration rate was not adversely affected and also the ability to eliminate a salt excess was also very well preserved, in a similar way as the untreated normotensive rats.
Thus, the slope of the chronic pressure natriuresis curve was not depressed, neither by the decrease in blood pressure nor by the drug itself, and the steepness of this relationship was maintained at the same level as the controls.
Previous studies using converting enzyme inhibitors in normal animals have shown that they effectively decrease blood pressure, even to hypotensive levels, but the slope of the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship is somewhat depressed, thus making blood pressure salt-sensitive [ 5 - 8 ].
In the present experiments, however, the chronic pressure natriuresis curve of the normotensive animals treated with omapatrilat was displaced to the left, that is to lower pressures, but the slope was not significantly changed, remaining essentially the same.
Thus, the normotensive animals were not salt-sensitive before the administration of the drug and they also remained salt-resistant after being treated with the vasopeptidase inhibitor.
The same can be safely said for the hypertensive animals.
It is likely that the difference between ACEIs alone and omapatrilat may be related to the greater natriuretic potency of the latter.
In fact, the omapatrilat-treated SHR showed a greater ability to excrete the sodium load, as evidenced by the lower sodium retention shown at day 1 (figure 2 ).
Moreover, recent data suggest that omapatrilat treatment is superior to <START:DRUG> captopril <END> in improving the altered endothelial function of a model of salt-sensitive hypertension [ 12 , 13 ].
It is also interesting to add that some authors have shown that SHRs, or at least some substrains of SHR, can be identified as salt-sensitive [ 14 ], in a similar way as other classical salt-sensitive rat models such as the DOCA-salt or the Dahl-sensitive rats.
However, the animals used in the present study did not show this tendency to increase their blood pressure in response to salt loading.
Thus, it can be concluded that chronic treatment with omapatrilat decreases blood pressure in SHRs, resetting the pressure natriuresis relationship to a normal level, thus without altering the normal salt-independence of this arterial hypertension model.
Material and Methods
Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and their normotensive controls (WKY), born and raised in the Animal House of the Universidad de Murcia, were used for the study (16 weeks of age).
The animals were maintained on standard rat chow and tap water throughout the study, unless otherwise stated.
All experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the European Union for the ethical treatment of the animals.
Experimental groups and protocol
Four groups of 8 animals each were used in the present study.
One group of WKY and SHR rats served as the untreated controls and one more group of WKY and SHR were treated chronically for 15 days with omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/day in the drinking water).
To construct the renal function curves, the animals were housed in metabolic cages and after 2 days of getting used to the cages, sodium balance (mEq/day) was calculated daily by subtracting sodium intake [food intake (g/day) × 0.104 mEq/g (sodium content of the food)] and sodium excretion [diuresis (ml/day) × urine sodium concentration (mEq/l)].
Two periods of four days each were observed.
In the first one (normal sodium intake), the animals were offered normal pulverized rat chow and tap water.
In the second one (high sodium intake), started immediately after the normal sodium period, sodium intake was elevated 8 times by adding the appropriate amounts of NaCl to the rat chow.
Blood pressure was measured twice in each period, before the period started and after the period finished.
In the case of the groups treated with omapatrilat, the animals were housed in the metabolic cages only the last 8 days of the treatment, to obtain the normal salt and the salt loading responses.
Blood pressure was determined by the tail cuff method (Cibertec, Madrid, Spain) by using MacLab software (AD Instruments, UK) in a Macintosh LCII computer.
This approach allowed the estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and then of mean arterial pressure.
Urine samples were measured by gravimetry, centrifuged and frozen to measure urinary creatinine and sodium concentrations.
A small blood sample was also obtained from the tail at the moment of blood pressure measurement for measurement of plasma creatinine.
Analytical techniques
Glomerular filtration rate was estimated as the clearance of creatinine (urine to plasma concentration ratio times diuresis).
Plasma and urine creatinine were measured by the Jaffe reaction using a commercially available kit (Boehringer Manheim, Barcelona, Spain).
Sodium concentration was measured by an ion selective electrode.
Statistical Methods
Data are presented as means ± S.E.M.
A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to obtain the statistical significance between and within groups.
Differences were considered statistically significant at a P level lower than 0.05.
Phorbol ester impairs electrical excitation of rat pancreatic beta-cells through PKC-independent activation of K ATP channels
Background
Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is often used as an activating phorbol ester of protein kinase C (PKC) to investigate the roles of the kinase in cellular functions.
Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that in addition to activating PKC, PMA also produces some regulatory effects in a PKC-independent manner.
In this study, we investigated the non-PKC effects of PMA on electrical excitability of rat pancreatic β-cells by using patch-clamp techniques.
Results
In current-clamp recording, PMA (80 nM) reversibly inhibited 15 mM glucose-induced action potential spikes superimposed on a slow membrane depolarization and this inhibition can not be prevented by pre-treatment of the cell with a specific PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, 1 μM).
In the presence of a subthreshold concentration (5.5 mM) of glucose, PMA hyperpolarized β-cells in a concentration-dependent manner (0.8–240 nM), even in the presence of BIM.
Based on cell-attached single channel recordings, PMA increased ATP-sensitive K + channel (K ATP ) activity.
Based on inside-out patch-clamp recordings, PMA had little effect on K ATP activity if no ATP was in the bath, while PMA restored K ATP activity that was suppressed by 10 μM ATP in the bath.
In voltage-clamp recording, PMA enhanced <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> -sensitive membrane currents elicited by repetitive ramp pulses from -90 to -50 mV in a concentration-dependent manner, and this potentiation could not be prevented by pre-treatment of cell with BIM.
4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), a non-PKC-activating phorbol ester, mimicked the effect of PMA on both current-clamp and voltage-clamp recording configurations.
With either 5.5 or 16.6 mM glucose in the extracellular solution, PMA (80 nM) increased insulin secretion from rat islets.
However, in islets pretreated with BIM (1 μM), PMA did not increase, but rather reduced insulin secretion.
Conclusion
In rat pancreatic β-cells, PMA modulates insulin secretion through a mixed mechanism: increases insulin secretion by activation of PKC, and meanwhile decrease insulin secretion by impairing β-cell excitability in a PKC-independent manner.
The enhancement of K ATP activity by reducing sensitivity of K ATP to ATP seems to underlie the PMA-induced impairment of β-cells electrical excitation in response to glucose stimulation.
Background
Phorbol esters are often used as activators of protein kinase C (PKC) to investigate the role of the kinase in cellular functions [ 1 ].
Pancreatic β-cells possess α, β1, δ and ε PKC isotypes [ 2 ], and activation of PKC is known to synergize with glucose stimulation in insulin secretion [ 3 - 5 ].
PKC, via protein phosphorylation seems to facilitate exocytosis of insulin granules [ 6 - 8 ].
In glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, ATP-sensitive K + channels (K ATP (SUR1, Kir6.2)) play a crucial role [ 9 , 10 ].
ATP produced by the metabolism of glucose inhibits K ATP activity, resulting in development of depolarization responsible for opening of L-type Ca 2+ channels, allowing Ca 2+ influx.
Elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] i ) accelerates exocytosis of insulin granules.
The possibility that K ATP activity is regulated by PKC has long been studied.
In this respect, however, contradictory results have been obtained.
For example, in insulin-secreting cell lines, PKC was reported to potentiate K ATP activity [ 11 , 12 ], although PKC-dependent inhibition [ 13 ] or inhibition followed by activation [ 14 ] has been also reported.
In primary β-cells from the mouse, activation of PKC by PMA did not cause any change in membrane potential [ 15 , 16 ], although in the same cell type, PMA reduced the glucose-stimulated elevation of [Ca 2+ ] i depending on activation of PKC [ 16 ].
On the other hand, recent studies in myocytes suggest that activation of PKC increases the open-time probability of K ATP (SUR2, Kir6.1) by reducing the sensitivity of K ATP to ATP [ 17 - 20 ].
Therefore, whether regulation of insulin secretion by PMA is mediated through PKC or not is still obscure.
Recently, we reported that phorbol ester inhibited Ca 2+ influx through PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways [ 21 ].
In the present study, we further evaluated the non-PKC mechanism of PMA action on β-cell electrical excitation by using patch-clamp techniques.
The results indicate that in rat pancreatic β-cells, PMA modulates insulin secretion through a mixed mechanism: increases insulin secretion by activation of PKC, and meanwhile decrease insulin secretion by impairing β-cell excitability in a PKC-independent manner.
The enhancement of K ATP activity by reducing sensitivity of K ATP to ATP seems to underlie the PMA-induced impairment of β-cells electrical excitation in response to glucose stimulation.
Results
PMA inhibits electrical excitation of single rat β-cells
With glucose at 5.5 mM in the extracellular solution, the membrane potential, measured using the <START:DRUG> nystatin <END> -perforation technique, was stable (-52.9 ± 1.1 mV, mean ± SE, n = 28).
Bath-applied 15 mM glucose induced the action potential spikes superimposed on a slow membrane depolarization (Fig. 1 panel A).
When PMA (80 nM) was applied to the cell during 15 mM glucose stimulation, both slow depolarization and action potentials was abolished.
The effect of PMA was reversible after removal of PMA (Fig. 1 panel A).
This inhibitory effect by PMA appeared to be independent of PKC since addition of the PKC blocker, BIM (1 μM) did not prevent PMA-induced inhibition (Fig. 1 panel B).
In two experiments, higher concentration (10 μM) of BIM failed to prevent PMA-induced inhibition too (data not shown).
In the presence of 5.5 mM glucose, 63% of tested β-cells (5/8) showed spontaneous action potentials superimposed on a slow depolarizing potential, and PMA (80 nM) inhibited these action potentials as well (Fig. 1 panel C).
Effect of PMA on electrical excitation of single rat pancreatic β-cells.
The membrane potential was measured the <START:DRUG> nystatin <END> -perforation method.
(A) Increases in extracellular glucose concentration from 5.5 to 15 mM induced a slow membrane depolarization superimposed on action potentials.
Addition of PMA (80 nM) inhibited action potentials also membrane depolarization.
(B) In the cell treated with BIM (1 μM, for one hour), PMA (80 nM) still inhibited extracellular glucose-induced membrane depolarization and action potentials.
(C) In the presence of 5.5 mM glucose, some cells (5/8) showed spontaneous electrical excitation, which also inhibited by PMA.
The concentration of glucose in the extracellular solution was 5.5 mM.
Dotted lines indicate the membrane potential level before stimulation with glucose or PMA.
Representative tracings from at least six experiments are shown.
PMA induces hyperpolarization of rat β-cells
In the presence of 5.5 mM glucose, application of PMA (80 nM) alone induced a slow, reversible membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 2 panel A).
The magnitude of the hyperpolarization depended on the concentration of PMA (Fig. 2 panel C).
Pretreatment of cells with the PKC inhibitor, BIM (1 μM) for about 60 min did not prevent PMA-induced hyperpolarization (Fig. 2 panel B).
Figure 2C summarized that PMA-induced hyperpolarization was not significantly different between BIM-treated and BIM-untreated β-cells (Fig. 2 panel C).
These results indicate that PMA-induced hyperpolarization of pancreatic β-cells is not mediated through PKC activation.

PMA increases K ATP activity in cell-attached single channel recording
Since K ATP plays a crucial role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, PMA-induced hyperpolarization could be mediated by changes in K ATP activity.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of PMA on single channel activities of K ATP .
In the cell-attached configuration, spontaneous single channel currents were recorded at a pipette potential of 0 mV (Fig. 3 ).
The specific K ATP blocker, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (0.5 mM) completely inhibited channel activity (Fig. 3 ), indicating that the recorded single channel currents are passed through K ATP channels.
Application of 80 nM PMA to the bath solution significantly increased channel activities (Fig. 3 ).
Values of open-time probability for K ATP were 0.08 ± 0.01 before application of PMA and 0.11 ± 0.01 during application of PMA (n = 9, Mean ± SEM, P < 0.01).
This result indicates that PMA indeed increases K ATP activity.
PMA induces K ATP activity recorded in the cell-attached configuration.
Single channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration are shown.
The pipette potential (Vp) was held at 0 mV.
Application of 80 nM PMA to the bath increased channel opening.
 <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (0.5 mM), applied to the bath during PMA, completely inhibited channel activity, suggesting that PMA increased K ATP activity.
PMA increases whole-cell membrane current through K ATP 
In the whole-cell configuration, membrane currents in response to repeatedly applied voltage ramp pulses from -90 to -50 mV were recorded.
 <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (0.5 mM) markedly reduced the size of the current, and after blockade of membrane current, PMA failed to increase the current (Fig. 4 panel A), suggesting that PMA increased membrane currents through K ATP .
Application of PMA (80 nM) increased the magnitude of membrane current (Fig. 4 panel B) and the magnitude of increased currents depended on the concentrations of PMA (Fig. 4 panel D).
In cells treated with BIM (1 μM), PMA still increased membrane current (Fig. 4 panel C).
No significant differences were observed between BIM-untreated and treated cells for PMA-induced membrane current increase (Fig. 4 panel D), suggesting that PMA increases K ATP -mediated currents in a PKC-independent manner.

4α-PDD mimics the effect of PMA on electrical properties of rat β-cells
There are two ways to test the hypothesis that the effect of PMA on electrical properties of rat β-cells is independent of PKC activation.
One is to use specific PKC blockers, like BIM, to examine whether the effect of PMA can be prevented (Fig. 1 , 2 , 4 ).
Another way is to employ PMA analogs, which do not stimulate PKC, to see if they can mimic the PMA effect.
4α-PDD, as a PKC non-stimulating phorbol ester [ 22 ], provides a good opportunity to test our hypothesis.
As shown in Fig. 5 panel A, 4α-PDD (1 μM) completely abolished action potentials elicited by elevation of glucose concentration from 5.5 to 15 mM, just like the PMA effect in Fig. 1 panel A. In voltage-clamp current recordings (Fig. 5 panel B), 4α-PDD (1 μM) increased membrane current evoked by ramp from -90 to -50 mV, similar to the PMA effect in figure 4 panel B. The similar results have also been obtained by low concentration of 4α-PDD (80 nM, n = 3 for current-clamp data and n = 2 for voltage-clamp data, data not shown).
These results indicate that 4α-PDD virtually mimics PMA effects, and these data further support the idea that the increase of K ATP activity by PMA does not depend on PKC activation.

Possible mechanism of PMA increases K ATP activity
How does PMA increase K ATP activity?
Two possible explanations might be addressed.
First, PMA reduces the sensitivity of K ATP to ATP as reports using myocytes [ 17 - 20 ].
Second, PMA may reduce ATP production.
To assess the effects of PMA on K ATP activity, we performed two experiments.
First, using inside-out recording configuration, spontaneous single channel activities were more prominent when there was no ATP in bath solution (intracellular face), and recorded currents were very sensitive to bath-applied <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (0.5 mM, Fig. 6 panel A).
In the absence of ATP in the bath, application of PMA showed little effect on K ATP activity (Fig. 6 panel B).
Values of the open-time probability for K ATP were 0.19 ± 0.02 (n = 12) without and 0.20 ± 0.02 (n = 5) with 80 nM PMA (P > 0.05).
The average single channel conductances were 68 pS without and 66 pS with 80 nM PMA, measured between -90 to 0 mV (Fig. 6 panel D).
Application of 10 μM ATP to the bath decreased the open probability of K ATP , and under this condition, PMA restored K ATP activity (Fig. 6 panel C) even in the presence of 1 μM BIM (Fig. 6 panel E).
Values for ATP concentration producing half-maximal inhibition of K ATP , taken from the concentration-response relationships of ATP inhibition of K ATP activity, were 10.8 ± 1.9 μM (n = 6) without and 24.9 ± 4.9 μM (n = 5) with 80 nM PMA (P <0.05, Fig. 6 panel F).
Values of the Hill coefficient were 1.04 ± 0.02 without and 1.08 ± 0.02 with PMA (P > 0.05).
These results indicate that PMA increases K ATP activity in the presence of intracellular ATP, which implies that PMA may reduce the sensitivity of K ATP to ATP.
Second, the ATP content of rat islets was measured during PMA treatment.
As shown in Table 1 ,10 min loading of islets with extracellular solution containing 80 nM PMA did not alter ATP content of islets.
On the other hand, loading cells with 1 mM NaCN markedly reduced ATP content.

 <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> was applied to the intracellular side of the membrane at 0.5 mM.
Inhibition of the current by <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> indicates that K ATP channel currents were recorded.
(B) 80 nM PMA was applied inside the membrane.
(C) ATP was first applied inside the membrane at 10 μM and then 80 nM PMA was further applied.
Note that K ATP activity was reduced by ATP, and application of PMA restored activity even in the presence of ATP.

Effects of PMA on glucose-induced insulin secretion
The results presented such far indicate that PMA decreases electrical excitation of β-cells and this effect is independent on PKC activation.
According to insulin secretion theory, decrease of electrical excitation of β-cells should reduce insulin secretion.
To address this question, we measured insulin secretion from rat islets.
As shown in Fig. 7 , PMA (80 nM) increase both basal (5.5 mM glucose in the extracellular solution) and evoked (16.6 mM glucose in the extracellular solution) insulin secretion rates.
However, as we expected, in BIM-treated islets PMA (80 nM) decreased the rates of insulin secretion (Fig. 7 ).
These data indicate that PMA regulates insulin secretion mediated by a mixed mechanism, a PKC-dependent increase of insulin secretion and a PKC-independent decrease of insulin secretion.

Discussion
Phorbol esters are often used as activators of PKC to investigate the role of the kinase in cellular functions [ 1 ].
Accumulating lines of evidence indicates that PMA plays a complex role in regulation of cellular function, including PKC-dependent [ 18 - 20 ] and PKC-independent ways [ 23 , 24 , 21 ].
In the present results, PMA inhibited slow membrane depolarization and action potentials in response to glucose stimulation (Fig. 1 ), and caused a membrane hyperpolarization in rat β-cells (Fig. 2 ).
These findings are consistent with the observation that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate lowers [Ca 2+ ] i at a stimulatory glucose concentration in pancreatic islets from obese-hyperglycaemic mice [ 16 ].
Since PMA increased K ATP activity (Fig. 3 ), it is obvious that the hyperpolarization caused by PMA results from activation of this channel type, and PMA inhibition of glucose-induced electrical excitation of rat β-cells is ascribable at least in part to hyperpolarization resulting from an increase in K ATP activity.
The activity of K ATP can be regulated by changes in intracellular concentration of ATP and/or ATP/ADP ratio [ 9 ].
In order to examine whether PMA decrease β-cell ATP concentration, we measured ATP content of rat islets, and results indicated that PMA did not change ATP levels in islets (Table 1 ).
It is not clear at present whether ADP concentrations are changed by the phorbol ester.
Under a condition where ATP concentration in the β-cell was clamped at a constant level, PMA increased <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> -sensitive currents in response to voltage ramps from -90 to -50 mV (Fig. 4 ).
Furthermore, in inside-out single channel recordings, PMA restored K ATP activity, which had been reduced by the preceding application of ATP (Figs.
6 panels C, E).
Together, these findings support the idea that PMA activation of K ATP does not result from a change in ATP concentration.
In cardiac myocytes, PMA is known to activate K ATP through activation of PKC [ 18 - 20 ].
In insulin-secreting cell lines as well, PKC activation by PMA was shown to potentiate K ATP activity [ 11 , 12 ].
In the present study, however, the activation of K ATP activity by PMA is independent on activation of PKC for two reasons.
First, the PKC activation inhibitor, BIM, did not prevent either the PMA-induced hyperpolarization (Figs.
2 panels B & C) or augmentation of whole-cell membrane currents (Fig. 4 panels C & D).
Second, the non-PKC-stimulating phorbol ester, 4α-PDD, mimicked the effect of PMA (Fig. 5 panel C).
Pharmacological effects of PMA independent of activation of PKC have been demonstrated in various tissues [ 23 , 24 ].
Since the magnitude of hyperpolarization induced by PMA (Fig. 2 panel C) and the effects of PMA on K ATP activity (Fig. 6 panel E) were not significantly different between cells treated or untreated with BIM, activation of PKC seems to show little effect on K ATP , at least in this cell type.
In this regard, the present findings support the idea derived from previous findings on mouse [ 15 ] or obese-hyperglycaemic mouse β-cells [ 16 ].
However, PMA-induced PKC-independent hyperpolarization of β-cells was not previously reported [ 15 , 16 ].
The reason for the discrepancy is not clear at the moment.
The difference in species (rat in the present study and mouse in previous studies) could be one explanation.
In addition, hyperpolarization in response to PMA might be unnoticed under some conditions with intracellular ATP at particular concentrations, because, as shown in Fig. 6 panel F, the effect of PMA on K ATP activity, which produces hyperpolarization, varied as a function of intracellular ATP concentration.
There are two possible explanations for the PKC-independent activation of K ATP by phorbol esters: 1) phorbol esters may increase K ATP activity in an intracellular ATP-independent manner and 2) phorbol esters may reduce sensitivity of K ATP to ATP.
The first possibility can be discounted because PMA does not affect K ATP activity in the absence of ATP (Fig. 6 panel B).
On the other hand, PMA restoration of K ATP activity which had been reduced by ATP (Fig. 6 panels C, E) supports the conclusion that phorbol esters decrease K ATP sensitivity to ATP.
In the present study, application of PMA potentiated insulin secretion from rat islets in response to elevation of extracellular glucose concentration (Fig. 7 ), supporting the hypothesis that activation of PKC synergizes secretory process activated by the glucose stimulation [ 3 - 5 ].
BIM is known to selectively inhibit α and β PKC isotypes [ 25 ], and rat pancreatic β-cells possess at least one PKC isotype [ 2 ].
In fact, in this study, the treatment of islets with BIM reversed the PMA effect on insulin secretion (Fig. 7 ).
Therefore, BIM can be used as a PKC inhibitor in rat pancreatic β-cells, as already shown in other tissues including murine macrophages [ 26 ], rat adrenal cortex [ 27 ], human melanocytes [ 28 ] and rabbit vetricular myocytes [ 20 ].
Recent reports with a truncated isoform of Kir6.2 have revealed that an ATP-inhibitory site lies on the Kir6.2 subunit [ 29 , 30 ].
In addition, mutations of the C-terminus of Kir6.2 showed that the amino acid sequence of the C-terminus was responsible for regulation of ATP sensitivity to K ATP [ 31 ].
It is not clear at present whether phorbol ester effects reflection at the C-terminus.
In addition, other recent studies have shown that the membrane phospholipid phosohatidylinositol-4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP 2 ) reduces sensitivity of K ATP to ATP, and therefore, activates K ATP [ 32 - 34 ].
To our knowledge, this is the first report of regulation of K ATP activity by phorbol ester in rat β-cells.
The present findings provide new insight into mechanisms of PMA regulation of insulin secretion by PMA.
Conclusion
The major and important finding in this study is that PMA impairs electrical excitation of rat pancreatic β-cells through PKC-independent mechanism.
PMA increases K ATP activity, induces a membrane hyperpolarization, then reduces the electrical excitability of pancreatic β-cells, leading to a decrease of insulin secretion.
Reduction of sensitivity of K ATP to ATP seems to underlie the PMA-induced impairment of β-cells electrical excitation in response to glucose stimulation.
These results provide a novel insight of modulation mechanism of insulin secretion by PMA, increases insulin secretion by activation of PKC, and meanwhile decrease insulin secretion by impairing β-cell excitability in a PKC-independent manner in rat pancreatic β-cells.
Materials and Methods
Islet preparation and β-cell isolation
Isolation of rat islets was performed as previously described [ 35 , 36 ].
In short, male adult rats (Wistar) were anesthetized with diethyl ether, and 10 ml Hank's buffered saline (HBSS) containing <START:DRUG> collagenase <END> (200 U/ml, Wako Chem., Japan) was injected into the common bile duct.
The pancreas swollen with digestion solution was quickly excised and incubated in a plastic culture bottle for 20 min at 37°C.
The suspension obtained by shaking the bottle was filtered through 0.5 mm metal mesh and washed with HBSS including 2% bovine <START:DRUG> serum albumin <END> (BSA).
About 100 islets were obtained from one rat with the histopaque (specific gravity 1.077, Sigma, USA) gradient method.
After washing with HBSS containing 2% BSA, islets were cultured for 24 hours with 5% C02 in the tissue culture medium.
Separation of islets was carried out using dispase (1000 U/ml, Godo Shusei, Japan) as previously described [ 35 ].
Separated cells were again cultured for 1–4 days.
Only single cells were chosen for experiments.
β-cells were identified by detecting the responses of the cells to 15 mM glucose or 0.5 mM <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (Sigma, USA).
Patch-clamp recordings
Cells were kept in a 35-mm Petri dish, and the dish was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (IMT-2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Membrane potentials and membrane currents were measured using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany).
The <START:DRUG> nystatin <END> -perforation method [ 37 ] was used to measure the membrane potential, and the standard method was used to measure whole-cell currents [ 38 ].
The resistance of the electrode, filled with the pipette solution, ranged from 2 to 4 MΩ.
To measure the whole-cell membrane current, voltage ramp pulses from -90 to -50 mV were repeatedly applied using a ramp pulse generator (SET-2100, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan).
The membrane capacitance ranged from 8 to 14 pF.
Series resistances below 12 MΩ were accepted.
Single channel current recordings were carried out by the cell-attached and inside-out configurations.
All electrophysiological experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Data of single channel currents were low-pass filtered at 1 KHz, digitized at 10 KHz and analyzed using a single channel current analysis program (QP-120J, Nihon Kohden).
The open time probability (Po) of the single channel was calculated according to the equation Po = 1 - Pc1/N where pc is the total closed time probability and N is the total number of channels.
The Po for K ATP was shown as function of the concentration of ATP.
Theoretical curves for ATP inhibition of K ATP activity were fitted to the Hill equation (P/Po)=l/{1+ ([ATP]/ki)h} where P is the open time probability with ATP at each concentration, Po is the open time probability without ATP, [ATP] is the concentration of ATP, ki is the ATP concentration at which the inhibition is half maximal, and h is the Hill coefficient.
Measurement of ATP content
The ATP concentration of islets was measured by the luciferin-luciferase method [ 39 ].
Assay kits (FL-ASC) were purchased from Sigma.
For ATP assay, 500 isolated rat pancreatic islets were suspended in 1.2 ml standard extracellular solution.
After application of PMA at the final concentration of 80 nM, islet suspensions containing 17 islets were transferred to reaction tubes, and the amount of emission was immediately measured using a luminescence reader (BLR-301, Aloka, Japan).
Bioluminescence produced by the luciferin-luciferase reaction was amplified and output as the count rate (cpm) after converting pulse signals.
Using a calibration curve, values of counting rate were calculated in terms of moles of ATP.
Measurement of insulin secretion
Isolated islets were hand-picked under microscopy, and ten islets were distributed to each 35-mm Petri dish with 3 ml of HBSS containing 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, and 2% BSA.
After pre-incubation for 60 min, islets were exposed to 1 μM BIM for 60 min, and then measured insulin secretion rate.
The PMA effects with or without BIM on insulin secretion were measured by using immuno-reactive insulin (IRI) and stored at -20°C until the assay.
IRI was measured by RIA using anti-human insulin antibody with rat insulin standard (Radio-immunoassay Kit, Insulin "Eiken", Tokyo Japan).

The ionic composition of the solution inside the membrane (bath solution) in inside-out recordings was the same as that of the pipette solution, but the pH of this solution was 7.2.
In inside-out recordings, ATP was added to the bath solution at various concentrations.
Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4a-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4a-PDD), bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) and NaCN were purchased from Sigma.
PMA and 4a-PDD were dissolved in <START:DRUG> ethanol <END> , and the final concentration of <START:DRUG> ethanol <END> in the experimental solution was less than 0.01%.
BIM was dissolved in DMSO, and the final concentration of DMSO in the experimental solution was 0.1%.

Effects of two atypical neuroleptics, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , on the function of the urinary bladder and the external urethral sphincter in anesthetized rats
Background
A previous report showed that the atypical neuroleptic <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> resulted in marked changes in urodynamic parameters and greatly inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter in anesthetized rats.
Such findings may help explain the high incidence of urinary disturbances reported during <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> therapy.
In an effort to extend our observations to other atypical neuroleptic agents, the present study investigated the effects of two newer atypical antipsychotics, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , on the bladder and external urethral sphincter during cystometry in anesthetized rats.
Results
At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.), <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> decreased the micturition volume and increased the residual volume.
In addition, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> decreased the expulsion time and the amplitude of the high frequency oscillations observed during the expulsion phase.
Larger doses (1 mg/kg) had a greater effect.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> also reduced the activity recorded from the external urethral sphincter, and the bursting observed during the expulsion phase was abolished by 1.0 mg/kg.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had similar effects although the maximal effects were smaller than those observed with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
The amplitude of bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve was reduced by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> but not <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> suggesting a possible anti-muscarinic peripheral effect of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
Conclusions
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> significantly altered several voiding parameters and decreased the activity of the external urethral sphincter in the anesthetized rat.
We propose that these effects are due to the central action of these drugs and not to peripheral effects.
These findings may explain some of the clinical reports of urinary incontinence with <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and may predict similar occurrences with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy.
Background
The lower urinary tract serves to store and periodically eliminate urine.
The activity of the urinary bladder and the external urethral sphincter must be properly coordinated in order for continence to be maintained and timely micturition to occur.
Effective micturition requires the coordination of central and peripheral nervous system structures that activate sympathetic, parasympathetic and somatic motor pathways innervating the bladder and the urethra (for a recent review see [ 1 ]).
Pathophysiological conditions and pharmacological manipulations that affect central and/or peripheral nervous system structures involved in micturition may alter the function of these two organs [ 2 ].
Atypical antipsychotic (neuroleptic) agents are favored over traditional antipsychotic medication (e.g. <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> ) because of their lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, their greater efficacy in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and their effectiveness in treating schizophrenic patients not responding to conventional neuroleptics [ 3 ].
However, side effects continue to pose a challenge to effective treatment [ 4 ].
These novel neuroleptics display a complex pharmacological profile with affinities for several receptor systems but are generally characterized by a greater affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor than for the target of the traditional neuroleptics, the D2 receptor [ 4 , 5 ].
We have shown recently that the atypical antipsychotic <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> , and to a lesser extent <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> , markedly influenced several micturition parameters in anesthetized rats [ 6 ].
 <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> decreased the micturition volume while increasing bladder capacity, thus increasing residual volume [ 7 ].
Moreover, <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> profoundly depressed the activity of the external urethral sphincter (EUS).
 <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> abolished the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from the EUS during the rising phase of a bladder contraction before urine is voided (similar to the "guarding reflex" [ 8 , 9 ]).
In addition, <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> also abolished the high frequency oscillations in the bladder pressure and accompanying bursts in the external urethral sphincter EMG, that are present during the expulsion phase of the micturition profile of the rat [ 7 ].
In the clinical literature, <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> therapy is associated with a high incidence (up to 44% in a recent study [ 10 ]) of urinary incontinence and enuresis.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> is a newer atypical antipsychotic agent with a pharmacological profile very similar to that of <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> [ 11 ].
In human brain tissue, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> displays very high affinity for the H1 histamine receptor, high affinity for 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors [ 12 ].
In addition it also shows affinity for D2, muscarinic, and alpha1 receptors, with lower affinity for alpha2, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1A receptors (Table 1 [ 12 ]).
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy is associated with a number of side effects, including somnolence, agitation, nervousness, headaches, dizziness, weight gain, constipation and dry mouth [ 5 ].
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , however, does not produce extrapyramidal side effects, postural hypotension or hemotoxicity (a particular problem for patients on <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> therapy [ 13 ]).
Although urinary retention as a result of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy may be predicted from binding studies due to <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> 's antimuscarinic activity [ 12 ] only 1 case report of micturition disturbance associated with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> has recently appeared [ 14 ].
On the other hand, several reports of urinary disturbances due to <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> can be found in the clinical literature [ 3 , 10 , 15 ].
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , another novel atypical neuroleptic, shows very high affinity for 5HT-2A receptors with lower affinity for D2 receptors.
In terms of profile <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> binds 5HT2A>>alpha1=H1>D2>alpha2 (Table 1 [ 12 , 16 ]).
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> displays little or no affinity for the muscarinic receptor [ 11 , 12 , 16 ] and yet <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> therapy has been associated with urinary incontinence (28% in some cases [ 17 - 19 ]).
We undertook this study to examine the effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on the cystometrogram of anesthetized rats.
These two novel atypical neuroleptic compounds are used in clinical practice and it might be important to identify possible side effects that may have an impact on compliance to therapy or adversely affect the patient's quality of life (e.g. persistent urinary incontinence).
Based on our previous findings with <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> , and given the similarity in pharmacological profiles between <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> , we hypothesized that <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> might also result in changes in urodynamic variables and/or external urethral sphincter EMG.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> provides an interesting comparison to <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> since it has a similar pharmacological profile to <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> but without the antimuscarinic activity.
In this study <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had greater effects than <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> but both decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume in anesthetized rats.
In addition, they inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , but not <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , also had peripheral effects that reduced bladder contraction amplitude to electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve.

 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect on bladder capacity (Fig 3A ) and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> increased BC only at the highest dose (10 mg/kg; Fig 2I,J ; 3A ) when the bladder capacity was 0.54 ml (S.E.M = ±0.08; Table 3 ) compared to 0.35 ml (±0.097) for vehicle-injected control.
Representative traces of the effects of cumulative intravenous doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> on the cystometrograms (CMG) and external urethral sphincter EMG of anesthetized rats (n = 5).
Top panel presents bladder pressure during CMG while bottom panel is integrated EMG recorded from the external urethral sphincter.
Panels A and B also show the different parameters recorded from the CMG: BC = amount of fluid infused to elicit a contraction; PT = pressure at which contraction begins; PP = maximal pressure during contraction; CT= contraction time; ET = time between peak pressure and end of high frequency oscillations.
The EMG activity was examined by dividing the bladder contraction into three phases in a modification of the technique of Chien et al.
[ 32 ] a contraction phase (phase 1); an expulsion phase (phase 2) and a closing phase (phase 3).
A) CMG following administration of control (saline).
(B) Expanded time scale showing the expulsion phase and the high frequency oscillations (HFO) in the bladder record, with accompanying bursting in the EMG.
C & D) 0.01 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> does not have an effect on the CMG or the external urethral sphincter EMG.
E & F) After 0.1 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , the amplitude of the HFO is diminished and the expulsion time is shortened.
G & H) 1 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> abolished HFO, there is no discernible expulsion time and the EMG record shows no bursting and a much lower level of activity compared to control.
Calibration bar: A,C,E,G = 1 min; B,D,F,H = 1 sec.
Representative traces of the effects of cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on the CMG and external urethral sphincter EMG of anesthetized rats (n = 7).
A & B) CMG after saline administration.
C & D) 0.01 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> did not affect expulsion time although residual volume was significantly increased (Table 3 ; Fig 3C ).
E & F) At 0.1 mg/kg, risperidione caused a reduction in the amplitude of the HFO and the expulsion time.
Larger doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (1 mg/kg, G & H; 10 mg/kg, I & J) continued to depress the expulsion time and reduced the external urethral sphincter EMG.
Note that the HFO were not abolished, unlike the results obtained with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .

Effects of cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on bladder capacity, micturition volume and residual.
A) Only the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (10 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect.
B) Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> significantly decreased the micturition volume (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg).
C) All doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> increased the residual volume whereas <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> resulted in significant increases at 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg.
* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01
Micturition volume, however, was decreased by both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
The mean micturition volume in the <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> group after administration of vehicle was 0.2 ml (±0.0.37).
However, after 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg the micturition volume dropped to 0.08 ml (±0.014) and 0.04 ml (±0.006), respectively (Fig. 3B ; Table 2 ).
Similarly, the <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> group had a mean micturition volume of 0.27 ml (±0.072) after vehicle injection, but there was a significant decrease to 0.1 ml (±0.019) and 0.12 ml (±0.016) after 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (Fig. 3B ; Table 3 ).
At 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , the micturition volume was 0.19 ml (± 0.036) which was not statistically different from the control values.
Consequently, the residual volume showed significant increases after 0.1 and 1 mg/kg doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (76 ± 5.3 and 89 ± 2.4%, respectively; Fig 3C ) and after all doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (maximal effect at 0.1 mg/kg; 70 ± 7.8%; Fig. 3C ).
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect on pressure threshold; however, <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> at 1 and 10 mg/kg resulted in a significant increase in the pressure threshold (5.0 ± 1.02 and 5.8 ± 1.02 mm Hg, respectively; Fig. 4A ) compared to the value observed during administration of vehicle (2.4 ± 0.62 mm Hg).
The peak pressure during contraction was not changed by any of the doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> tested in this study (Fig. 4B ).
Interestingly, 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> showed a modest, but statistically significant increase in peak contraction pressure (13.7 ± 1.34 mm Hg compared to control value of 11.5 ± 0.95 mm Hg; Fig. 4B ).
Effects of cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on pressure threshold and peak pressure during cystometrograms.
A) <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no significant effects on the pressure threshold.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , however, increased PT at 1 and 10 mg/kg.
B) <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect on peak pressure.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> significantly increased PP only at the highest dose (10 mg/kg).
* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01
The contraction time was not affected by either <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> or <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (Fig. 5A ) but the expulsion time (the time during which the HFO occur) was significantly decreased by both (Fig. 1 ; Fig. 2 ; Fig. 5B ).
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> decreased the expulsion time from 2.6 (±0.55) sec after vehicle injection to 0.9 (±0.38) and 0 sec after 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 5B ).
The <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> group had an expulsion time of 3.6 (±0.83) sec after control and it decreased to 1.5 (±0.34) and 1.4 (±0.35) sec after 0.1 and 1 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (Fig 5B ).
At 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , the expulsion time was 2.2 (± 0.46) sec.
Effects of cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on contraction time, expulsion time and the amplitude of the high frequency oscillations.
A) Neither <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> nor <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> significantly changed the contraction time.
B) The expulsion time was significantly decreased by both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> abolished the expulsion time at 1.0 mg/kg.
C) The amplitude of the HFO was significantly decreased by both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
Olanzanpine had a greater effect, abolishing the HFO at 1.0 mg/kg, whereas <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> decreased the amplitude to approximately 50% of control values.
* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01
Similarly, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> significantly decreased the amplitude of high frequency oscillations (HFO) from a control value of 1.6 (±0.19) to 1.0 (±0.38) mm Hg at 0.1 mg/kg and abolished the HFO in all animals tested at 1 mg/kg (Fig. 1 ; 5C ).
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> also reduced the amplitude of the HFO from 1.6 (±0.19) to 1.0 (±0.22), 0.9 (±0.18) and 1.1 (± 0.22) mm Hg after 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (Fig. 2 ; 5C ).
Effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on the external urethral sphincter (Tables 2 and 3 )
The EMG recorded from the urethral sphincter during bladder contractions also showed changes after <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> or <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
Phase 1 of the EMG, occurring during the initial rise in bladder pressure during a contraction, was significantly decreased by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg to 76 (±1.9) and 47 (±6.0) percent of the control value (Fig. 1F;1H ; 6A ).
However, <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had no significant effect on the EMG during phase 1 (Fig 6A ).
Effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on the integrated EMG recorded from the external urethral sphincter.
A) The EMG during Phase 1, which may be analogous to the "guarding reflex" was significantly decreased by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg).
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had no effect.
B) Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had a significant effect on the EMG during Phase 2.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had greater effects, essentially abolishing the bursting pattern of the EMG after 1.0 mg/kg.
C) Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> decreased the EMG during phase 3.
However, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had a greater effect (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) than <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
D) The amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG observed during phase 2 were not significantly affected by <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect at 0.1 mg/kg but at 1.0 mg/kg abolished the bursting pattern.
Phase 2, which corresponds to the occurrence of high frequency oscillations, showed significant decreases in the integrated EMG following <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> or <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> administration.
0.1 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> significantly decreased the overall EMG during this phase to 42 (±11.4)% of the control value, and 1.0 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> abolished the bursting pattern of EMG (Fig 1G;1H ; Fig 6B ).
While <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> also decreased the Phase 2 EMG, the maximal decrease was 47 (±12.7)% at 1.0 mg/kg when compared to control (Fig 6B ) and the bursting pattern was not abolished.
At 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , the phase 2 EMG was 71 (± 22) % and was not significantly different from vehicle.
Phase 3 of the EMG during a bladder contraction also showed significant changes following <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> or <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (Fig 6C ).
Both drugs significantly decreased the amount of integrated EMG but 0.1 mg/kg <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had a more profound effect (Fig 6C ), reducing the EMG to 35 (±5.2) % of the control value at 1.0 mg/kg compared to 68 (±8.0) % of control after a similar dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
At 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> the EMG was 73 (± 9.0) % of vehicle.
Finally, while <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had no effect on the amplitude of the EMG bursts occurring the expulsion phase (Fig 1 ; Fig 6D ), <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> abolished bursting of the EMG at 1.0 mg/kg in all animals tested (Fig 1H ; 6D ).
Effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on blood pressure
Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) in anesthetized rats (Fig. 7 ).
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> produced significant effects at all the doses tested, with a maximum drop in MAP of approximately 46 mm Hg at 1 mg/kg (Mean = 44 mm Hg; SEM ±1.37).
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> showed a significant decrease in MAP at 1.0 mg/kg with a maximum drop of approximately 26 mm Hg (Mean = 55 ± 3.76 mm Hg).
In two animals where <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> was administered at 10 mg/kg, there was no further reduction in MAP (Mean = 57 ± 4.95 mm Hg), however, significant respiratory depression was observed and therefore we excluded this dose for the remaining animals receiving <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
Mean arterial pressure changes as a result of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
Both of these drugs caused a marked drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP), with <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> having a larger effect than <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
All doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> resulted in significant decreases in MAP, whereas only the highest dose of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant decrease in MAP.

Effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve
Prolonged electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve elicits a sustained bladder contraction with two components.
An initial rise in bladder pressure (Phase I; Fig. 8A ) that is resistant to muscarinic blockade and a sustained part of the contraction (Phase II or plateau phase) that is very sensitive to anti-muscarinic agents [ 20 , 21 ].
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> at 1 and 10 mg/kg reduced the amplitude of Phase I to 79 and 74% of the control values, respectively (Fig. 8A;B ).
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , on the other hand, significantly increased the amplitude of phase I after 10 mg/kg (116% of control).
Peripheral anti-muscarinic effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
A) Prolonged (60 sec) electrical stimulation of the cut distal end of the pelvic nerve results in a bladder contraction.
The amplitude of the initial rise of the contraction (Phase I) is resistant to muscarinic blockade.
The plateau phase (Phase II), however, is very sensitive to anti-muscarinic agents.
After 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , Phase I is somewhat decreased, but phase II is markedly reduced.
After 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , Phase I is larger than control, while phase II is unchanged.
B) Phase I amplitude as a function of cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> decreased the amplitude at 1 and 10 mg/kg.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> did not reduce the amplitude but it significantly increased the amplitude at 10 mg/kg.
C) Phase II amplitude was markedly reduced by 1 and 10 mg/kg of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> whereas <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had no effect.
* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01.
The plateau phase, or phase II of the pelvic nerve induced bladder contraction was significantly reduced by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (Fig. 8A ; 6C ).
At 1 and 10 mg/kg, the response was 47 and 33% of the control values, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had no effect on Phase II amplitude (Fig. 8A; 8C ).
Discussion
Similar to our findings with <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> [ 7 ], <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and to a lesser extent <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , altered several urodynamic parameters measured during cystometry and also inhibited the EMG recorded from the external urethral sphincter.
Effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on urodynamic parameters and the external sphincter EMG
Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> are compounds with relatively high oral bioavailability.
Clinically effective doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (10–15 mg/day; 18.4–30.6 ng/ml plasma concentration [ 22 - 24 ]) or <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (3–6 mg/day; 15–30.8 ng/ml combined plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and 9-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> [ 25 ]) correspond well with the dose of 1.0 mg/kg (equivalent to 12.5 ng/ml) in the present study.
Both neuroleptics markedly decreased the micturition volume, expulsion time, and amplitude of the HFO while residual volume increased.
Most of the effects of either neuroleptic occurred at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> appeared to have a greater maximal effect than <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
At the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (10 mg/kg) there was less of an effect for the urodynamic parameters mentioned above.
This is an interesting observation that was not explored further in the present study.
The physiological significance is unclear since the 10 mg/kg dose is well above the clinically effective doses of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> did not have an effect on bladder capacity or pressure threshold while <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> increased both although only at the highest doses.
 <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> , on the other hand, was observed previously to increase bladder capacity and pressure threshold [ 6 , 7 ].
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had no effect on bladder peak pressure during contraction and only the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> showed an increase in pressure (119% of control).
The increase in pressure after the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> was interesting and was also observed following electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve suggesting a possible peripheral mechanism.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , but not <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , decreased the integrated EMG recorded during the beginning of a bladder contraction (Phase 1; comparable to the guarding reflex).
Both neuroleptics decreased the EMG during phase 2, where high frequency oscillations occur in the bladder pressure along with bursting in the EUS, with the highest dose of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (1.0 mg/kg) abolishing the HFO and the bursting pattern.
The integrated EMG recorded during the end of the bladder contraction (Phase 3) was also decreased by both neuroleptics, with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> reducing it to 69% and 35% at 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, whereas the maximal effect for <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> was observed at 1 mg/kg (68%).
Finally, neither neuroleptic decreased the amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG recorded during phase 2, except for the largest dose of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (1 mg/kg) that abolished the bursting pattern.
Therefore, as was the case for urodynamic parameters, although both neuroleptics decreased the activity of the external urethral sphincter (as reflected in the integrated EMG), it appears that the effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> were greater than those of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
As was the case for some urodynamic parameters, the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> showed a parabolic effect for some of the EMG parameters.
Blockade of the external urethral sphincter in anesthetized rats results in a disappearance of the HFO from the bladder pressure recording as well as a disappearance of the bursting pattern of the EUS EMG observed during HFO [ 26 - 28 ].
In addition, there is a decreased ability of the bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition volume and an increased residual volume [ 26 , 27 , 29 ].
Therefore, inhibition of the external urethral sphincter, as was the case for the two neuroleptics in the present study and also for <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> in our earlier study [ 7 ], might provide an important mechanism by which the bladder is rendered less effective in emptying and therefore altering other urodynamic variables resulting in decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume in rats.
Possible neuropharmacological mechanisms for the effect of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> on the lower urinary tract
We tested for peripheral antimuscarinic actions of both neuroleptics by examining their effects on bladder contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve.
In this preparation, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> but not <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> reduced the initial contraction amplitude (Phase I) somewhat and markedly depressed the prolonged contraction phase (Phase II; Fig. 8 ) that is thought to be mediated by muscarinic receptors [ 20 , 21 ].
During cystometry, however, neither <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> nor <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> affected the peak pressure during bladder contraction.
Therefore, although <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had a peripheral effect on bladder contraction amplitude, as might be expected from its antimuscarinic effects, this effect is not reflected in the peak contraction pressures observed during cystometry.
This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that during a bladder contraction against a closed outlet (electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve) higher pressures were developed than were observed during cystometry when the outlet was not obstructed.
Since the clinically effective dose of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (10–15 mg/day; 18.4–30.6 ng/ml plasma concentration [ 22 - 24 ]) is greater than the first dose observed to produce significant peripheral antimuscarinic effects in this study (1.0 mg/kg; equivalent to 12.5 ng/ml plasma concentration) a possible peripheral anti-muscarinic on the bladder during <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy remains a concern.
Muscarinic blockade with <START:DRUG> atropine <END> decreased micturition pressure and micturition volume, while increasing residual volume [ 30 ] and bladder capacity [ 31 ].
Similarly, central administration of <START:DRUG> atropine <END> decreased peak pressure and voiding efficiency while increasing bladder capacity in awake rats [ 32 ].
Thus it is possible that central and/or peripheral muscarinic blockade by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> may have contributed to some of the changes observed in these parameters in the present study.
Muscarinic blockade was also reported to decrease the EUS EMG in all phases of the bladder contraction [ 33 ].
However, another study showed no effect on the EUS EMG following muscarinic antagonism [ 34 ].
Therefore, the exact role of muscarinic blockade on the activity of the EUS in the rat is unclear.
It is tempting to propose that the greater effect of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> on the EUS may be due to its antimuscarinic activity, which <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> does not have.
In fact, <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> has a greater affinity for muscarinic receptors than <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> [ 11 ] and <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> was also able to decrease the EMG and abolish the bursting pattern during phase 2.
Whether muscarinic blockade affects the activity of the EUS by acting on central or peripheral sites remains to be determined.
A direct inhibitory action of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> on the EUS muscle itself is not expected and was not seen with <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> [ 7 ].
However, antimuscarinic effects alone cannot account for all of the effects of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> on the EUS, since <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> had a similar effect although not quite as pronounced and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> has little or no affinity for muscarinic receptors [ 16 ].
Therefore, antagonism of other transmitter systems, e.g. D2, alpha1, 5-HT2, remains as an explanation of the effects of these neuroleptics on urodynamic variables [ 6 ].
Selective antagonism of D2 receptors only modestly reduced the amplitude of HFO without affecting any other urodynamic parameters [ 6 , 35 ].
Therefore, it is possible that <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> decrease the amplitude of the HFO, at least partly, through antagonism of D2 receptors.
In anesthetized rats, <START:DRUG> doxazosin <END> (alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist) administered systemically, increased micturition volume, bladder capacity, residual volume and micturition frequency while decreasing peak pressure [ 36 ].
Only an increase in the micturition frequency was observed after spinal administration of <START:DRUG> doxazosin <END> [ 37 ].
Both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> have moderate affinity for the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor (Table 1 ), therefore it is possible that some of the effects observed in the present study were due to central and/or peripheral antagonism of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors by these drugs.
The decreases observed in MAP suggest a possible peripheral alpha1 effect.
However, we did not observe a decrease in the peak pressure as would have been predicted from previous studies using selective alpha 1 antagonism [ 36 ].
In addition, bladder capacity was not affected except at the highest dose of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> tested.
Urinary incontinence as a result of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> [ 12 ] or <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> [ 15 ] therapy was treated effectively with <START:DRUG> ephedrine <END> (alpha adrenergic receptor agonist), suggesting a possible alpha1 effect.
However, alpha1a-adrenoceptor gene polymorphism was found to play no role in <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> -induced urinary incontinence [ 38 ].
In terms of the effects on the EUS, alpha 1 antagonists have been shown to inhibit the EUS in the cat [ 39 - 41 ] but not in the anesthetized rat [ 42 ].
Finally, both <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> posses affinities to several serotonin receptor subtypes (Table 1 ).
In cats, serotonin antagonists caused a decrease in bladder capacity [ 43 ] however in anesthetized rats, serotonin antagonism did not have an effect on micturition [ 44 ].
Recently, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (WAY-100635) was reported to inhibit bladder contractions in rats [ 45 ] yet another report only observed an increase in the pressure threshold [ 46 ].
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> have only low to modest affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, and higher affinities for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors [ 11 , 12 ].
Serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors facilitate pudendal reflexes in the cat [ 47 , 48 ], therefore it is possible that antagonism of these receptors may block the EUS in the anesthetized rat.
Given the modest role of serotonin receptors in micturition in anesthetized rats, it remains to be determined whether the effects observed here were due to anti-serotonergic effects of these neuroleptics.
Clinical implications
While there are several reports of urinary disturbances following <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> therapy [ 3 , 10 , 15 ], there are relatively few reports of urinary incontinence with <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> or <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
In one report, twenty-eight (28%) of patients on <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> developed at least transient urinary incontinence, compared to 13% before starting treatment [ 18 ].
Other reports also suggest urinary incontinence associated with <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> therapy [ 17 , 19 ].
To date, only one case report of urinary incontinence with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy that resolved with ephredrine was found in the literature [ 14 ].
In the present study, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> had more profound effects on urodynamic parameters and the EUS than <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and therefore the incidence of urinary disturbances in clinical practice would be predicted to be higher.
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> is a newer compound than <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> or <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and therefore, a larger incidence of urinary symptoms with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> therapy may await a larger sampling.
Finally, possible side effects of neuroleptics, such as urinary retention, may be predicted from binding studies using human brain tissue [ 12 ] if antimuscarinic affinities will correspond to antimuscarinic effects on the bladder.
However, <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> may also result in urinary disturbances by their influence on central pathways mediating bladder contractions or coordinating external urethral sphincter, as may have been the case in the present study.
Such effects may not be readily apparent or predictable from receptor binding studies.
Conclusions
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and to a lesser extent <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , altered several micturition parameters and they inhibited the external urethral sphincter in the anesthetized rat.
These effects resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition volume and an increase in the residual volume, and a decreased activity of the external urethral sphincter.
Although <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> also showed peripheral anti-muscarinic effects on bladder contractions, <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> did not.
Therefore, peripheral anti-muscarinic effects alone cannot explain all the changes observed with these drugs and they might reflect central effects on micturition pathways.
Materials and Methods
The experiments were conducted in compliance with the USDA Animal Welfare Act and amendments thereto and the revised Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals DHEW (NIH) and were approved by the Animal Studies Subcommittee of the Bay Pines Veterans Administration Medical Center.
Surgical procedures have been described in detail elsewhere [ 7 ].
Briefly, rats (female Sprague-Dawley; n = 20; 200–250 g; Harlan; IN) were anesthetized with <START:DRUG> halothane <END> and placed on a heating pad.
A catheter (PE-50) was introduced into the jugular vein to administer urethane (1.1 g/kg) over a period of 20 minutes while decreasing the level of <START:DRUG> halothane <END> to prevent respiratory depression.
After an abdominal incision, both ureters were exteriorized (PE 10) and a catheter (PE-90) was introduced into the bladder dome and tied in place with a purse string suture.
A catheter (PE-50) was introduced into the right femoral artery for blood pressure recording.
Stainless-steel wires (0.003 in.; A-M Systems; WA) insulated except at the tip were introduced into the external urethral sphincter for EMG recording.
Urodynamic Studies
The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to air pressure for 5 minutes before beginning each cystometrogram.
Room temperature saline was infused into the bladder (0.11 ml/min) while recording bladder pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction occurred.
Volume expelled was determined by placing cotton gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before and after micturition.
External urethral sphincter EMG (EUS-EMG) was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and for sometime after the filling had stopped.
Cumulative doses of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (provided as a courtesy by Ely Lilly, Indianapolis; vehicle, 0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg; n = 5) and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (RBI; vehicle, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg; n = 7) were administered i.v.
at approximately 10 minute intervals.
The plasma half-life of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> are 2.5 and 15 hr, respectively [ 25 , 49 ].
Both drugs were dissolved in a minimal amount of 0.1 N HCl, and brought up to volume with saline (final pH = 6).
Cystometrograms were started approximately 3 minutes after each drug administration.
Bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve stimulation
In order to determine the direct peripheral effects of these drugs on the bladder, the distal end of a pelvic nerve was stimulated electrically to elicit a bladder contraction (n = 8).
Both hypogastric and pelvic nerves were cut before they entered the major pelvic ganglion and a tie was placed around the urinary meatus to preserve isovolumetric conditions.
After infusing 0.1–0.2 ml into the bladder the distal, cut end of the pelvic nerve was stimulated with a long train (5 Hz; 1 msec pulse width; 60 sec train; 30–300 (uamps) to elicit a prolonged contraction displaying two phases: Phase I, a rapid contraction and Phase II, a plateau phase [ 20 , 21 ].
Phase I is resistant to <START:DRUG> atropine <END> , and therefore is mostly due to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic activation, whereas Phase II is highly sensitive to muscarinic blockade [ 21 ].
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (n = 4) and <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (n = 4) were administered (0.01,0.1,1 and 10 mg/kg; i.v.) and the stimulations were repeated at 10 minutes intervals.
At the end of each experiment, all rats were overdosed with urethane i.v.
Data analysis
Bladder pressure and EUS-EMG during the cystometrograms were displayed in an electronic chart recorder (RC Electronics; Goleta, CA) and analyzed off-line (Dataview, W.J.
Heitler, U. St Andrews, Scotland).
The following parameters were examined from the cystometrogram as described in detail earlier [ 7 ]: bladder capacity (amount of fluid infused to elicit a contraction); micturition volume (amount of fluid expelled); residual volume ([bladder capacity – micturition volume]/ [bladder capacity]); pressure threshold (pressure at which contraction begins); peak pressure (maximal pressure during contraction); contraction time; expulsion time (time between peak pressure and end of high frequency oscillations); amplitude of high frequency oscillations.
The EMG activity was examined by dividing the bladder contraction into three phases in a modification of the technique of Chien et al.
[ 33 ] a contraction phase (phase 1); an expulsion phase (phase 2) and a closing phase (phase 3).
The raw EMG was rectified, integrated (0.5 second bin) and the area under curve of the EMG corresponding to each phase of the bladder contraction was measured (Sigma Scan/Image; Jandel Scientifics, San Rafael, Ca).
Drug effects were calculated as percent of control.
In the case of bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve stimulation, the amplitude of phase A and Phase B were compared to drug free control values.
Values are presented as Mean ± S.E.M.
Repeated measures ANOVA (GB Stat; Dynamic Microsystems; MD) were performed on all parameters and when statistical significance (p < 0.05) was obtained, comparisons between control and different drug dosages were made using Fisher's protected t-test [ 50 ].

Inability of Serotonin to Activate the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase and p38  Kinase Pathways in Rat Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
Background
Serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) activates the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK)/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways, in vascular smooth muscle cells.
Parallel MAPK pathways, the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and p38 pathway, are activated by stimulators of the ERK/MAPK pathway.
We hypothesized that 5-HT would activate the JNK and p38 pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
Results
Results were determined using standard Western analysis and phosphospecific JNK and p38 antibodies.
No significant activation by 5-HT (10 -9 – 10 -5 M; 30 min) of the JNK or p38 pathways, as measured by protein phosphorylation, was observed in any of these experiments.
These experiments were repeated in the presence of the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (1 uM) and the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (1 uM) to maximize any observable signal.
Even under these optimized conditions, no activation of the JNK or p38 pathways by 5-HT was observed.
Time course experiments (5-HT 10 -5 M; 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min) showed no significant activation of JNK after incubation with 5-HT at any time point.
However, we detected strong activation of JNK p54 and p46 (5- and 7 fold increases in bands p54 and p46, respectively over control levels) by <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> (500 ng/ml, 30 min).
Similarly, a JNK activity assay failed to reveal activation of JNK by 5-HT, in contrast to the strong stimulation by <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> .
Conclusion
Collectively, these data support the conclusion that 5-HT does not activate the JNK or p38 pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
Background
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family consists of three commonly recognized subgroups: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as the stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) and the p38 kinase.
While many actions have been associated with activation of the ERK pathway, two particular functions of interest to our laboratory are mitogen-stimulated growth [ 1 ] and smooth muscle cell contraction [ 2 ].
Of the three MAPK pathways, activation of the ERK pathway and the intracellular signaling pathways associated with ERK activation are the best delineated.
Known activators include reactive oxygen species [ 3 , 4 ], growth factors [ 5 ], and agonists of G-protein coupled receptors [ 6 , 7 ].
The two other MAPK pathways, the JNK and p38 pathways, have been implicated in a variety of similar cellular functions.
Known activators of the JNK and p38 pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells include reactive oxygen species [ 8 , 9 ], mechanical strain [ 10 , 11 ], hypoxia [ 12 ] and a variety of cytokines and growth factors.
The mechanisms of many cellular functions of the JNK and p38 pathways are not yet clearly defined.
The JNK pathway is involved in apoptosis [ 13 ], arginine <START:DRUG> vasopressin <END> -induced increases in smooth muscle α-actin in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 14 ] as well as in phosphorylation of transcription factors c-jun, ATF-2 and ELK-1 and phosphorylation of Na-K-2CI cotransporter [ 15 ].
The p38 pathway has been implicated in apoptosis [ 16 ], neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury [ 17 ] as well as angiotensin ll-induced contraction in vascular smooth muscle [ 18 ].
Recently, it has been noted that the JNK and p38 pathways can be activated by G-protein coupled receptor agonists, notably angiotensin II, in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 19 , 20 ].
In cardiac myocytes, both the p38 and JNK pathways have been activated by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the α 1 adrenergic receptor agonist <START:DRUG> phenylephrine <END> [ 21 ].
The ability of the JNK and p38 pathways to be activated by the same agonists of G-protein coupled receptors which activate the ERK pathway led to the investigation of 5-HT as a possible activator of the JNK and p38 pathways.
5-HT, acting via the 5-HT 2A receptor, is a known activator of the ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 2 , 22 ].
In these studies we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT would activate the JNK and p38 pathways in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells.
Results
The ERK pathway
In agreement with previously published studies from our lab, 5-HT caused a concentration-dependent activation of the ERK pathway (figure 1 ).
This activation occurs maximally at five minutes of stimulation and returns to basal levels by thirty minutes [ 23 ].
This time course of activation is consistent with that of other G-protein coupled receptors.

The p38 pathway
The p38 pathway has demonstrated a different time course of activation via G- protein coupled receptors than the ERK pathway [ 24 ].
Using the time point (30 min) at which angiotensin II demonstrates maximal stimulation of the JNK pathway we performed a concentration response curve (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) to 5-HT in vascular smooth muscle cells.
Western analysis using phosphospecific antibodies was used to measure activation the p38 pathway.
A total or non-phosphospecific antibody was used to ensure equal loading of p38 protein.
After thirty-minutes of incubation with 5-HT (10 -9 – 10 -5 M), there was no enhanced phosphorylation of p38 (figure 2 , bottom).
In contrast, incubation with <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> (500 ng/ml) induced significant phosphorylation of p38 (2-fold above basal).
These data suggest that 5-HT does not activate the p38 pathway in rat vascular smooth muscle cells despite the ability of other agonists to activate the pathway in these cells.

The JNK pathway
Figure 3 shows that thirty minutes of incubation with 5-HT (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) resulted in a trend towards a modest increase in phosphorylation of the p46 JNK isoform.
This trend, however, was not statistically significant.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> (500 ng/ml) induced significant phosphorylation of the p46 JNK isoform (5–7 fold above basal).
Both the p54 and p46 bands were analyzed by densitometry (data for p54 not shown).
However, incubation with 5-HT did not produce statistically significant activation in either band when compared to vehicle.
These data suggest that 5-HT does not substantially activate the JNK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.
However, the data obtained with <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> provides evidence that this pathway can be activated in these cells.

To confirm that thirty minutes was an optimal time point for observing 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of JNK, we next performed a time course of JNK phosphorylation after exposure to 5-HT in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
At no time point (5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min) did 5-HT (10 -5 M) enhance JNK phosphorylation above basal levels (figure 4 ).
These data fail to support a role for 5-HT-induced activation of the JNK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.

To demonstrate that a G-protein coupled receptor agonist could activate the JNK pathway in our vascular smooth muscle cells, we incubated the cells with angiotensin II (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) for thirty minutes.
Angiotensin II (10 -8 – 10 -5 M) produced a significant increase in the level of JNK phosphorylation (figure 5 ).
The authors speculate that the differences in the level of phosphorylation of the p46 JNK isoform in the vehicle treatment group maybe due to differences in the JNK expression over time in cultured cells.
The cells used in these experiments were of a later passage than those used for the 5-HT incubation studies.
These data, in addition to that obtained with <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> , demonstrate that in these vascular smooth muscle cells the JNK pathway can be activated.

Due to the trend toward increased phosphorylation of both the p46 and p54 JNK isoforms by 5-HT, we next performed JNK activity assays to determine whether 5-HT had any significant effect on kinase activity.
This assay was chosen to ensure that the western analyses used were sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the activation of the JNK pathway.
There was no significant difference in the levels of activity at any concentration of 5-HT (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) after thirty minutes of incubation in vascular smooth muscle cells (figure 6 ).
In contrast, <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> (500 ng/ml, 30 min) produced a significant increase in JNK activation (approximately 2-fold above basal).
These data, in combination with the above findings, do not support a role for 5-HT in the activation of the JNK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Conclusions
5-HT is an activator of the ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.
In contrast, 5-HT appears to be unable to activate the JNK and p38 pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells.
No observable changes in activation, as measured by phosphorylation status, were seen at any of the 5-HT concentrations (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) or time points (5 min, 30 min, 60 min and 2 hr) examined.
The data from the kinase activity assay also demonstrated no activation of the JNK pathway by 5-HT.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase family is associated with many cellular functions.
The ability of 5-HT to activate the ERK pathway is consistent with 5-HT's role as a mitogenic stimulus and vasoconstrictor.
Several vasoactive G-protein coupled agonists, including angiotensin II and endothelin, have also been shown to activate the ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 6 , 21 ].
These same hormones also activate the JNK and p38 pathways.
These agonists have different time course and concentration profiles for activation of the different MAPK pathways.
ERK activation by angiotensin II and 5-HT occurs at relatively lower agonist concentrations and within five minutes of stimulation (19,23).
The activation of p38 and JNK pathways by angiotensin II and endothelin occurs at higher concentrations of agonist and requires a longer incubation with the stimulus [ 18 , 19 , 25 ].
There are data which also suggest that different signal transduction pathways are utilized for the different pathways [ 25 - 27 ].
This differential activation of MAPK pathways is most likely due to the role that each plays in the cell.
The ERK pathway is associated with growth where as the p38 and JNK pathways are "stress response" pathways.
In light of data for the other G-protein coupled receptor agonists, the inability of 5-HT, also G-protein coupled receptor, was initially surprising.
While 5-HT has never been shown to increase activation of either the p38 or JNK pathways, it has been linked to ERK activation.
The 5-HT 2A receptor is the primary serotonergic receptor which couples to activation the ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 28 ].
5-HT's inability to activate the JNK and p38 pathways may be due to a lack of coupling of the 5-HT 2A receptor signaling pathway to the components in the JNK and p38 pathways.
It has recently been suggested that G-protein coupled receptors with PDZ domains, SH2-containing domains and PTB domains participate in protein-protein interactions with partners other than G-proteins, such as Grb2 and JAK2, which may allow these receptors to bypass the G-proteins and utilize other signaling cascades (29).
This ability of G-protein coupled receptors to modulate the signal cascade used, independent of G-proteins, suggests a broader range of interaction with signaling components.
This may provide one explanation for the 5-HT activation of the ERK and its lack of effect on the JNK and p38 pathways.
Another possible explanation for the differential activation of the MAPK pathways by 5-HT may relate to the varied roles 5-HT in different cell types and the multiple receptors which mediate these roles.
When examining the physiological role of 5-HT in other cell types, in regards to apoptosis and cellular responses to stress, 5-HT is generally anti-apoptotic [ 30 - 32 ].
In particular, in neuronal cells the 5-HT 1A receptor is upregulated under conditions of cellular stress and is anti-apoptotic [ 33 , 34 ].
The anti-apoptotic effects of 5-HT maybe due to scavenging of reactive oxygen species [ 35 ] as well as stimulation of the ERK pathway which results in inhibition of a caspase-3-like enzyme [ 32 ].
There are no currently published studies examining the role of 5-HT as an anti-apoptotic factor in vascular smooth muscle cells.
It may be that under stressful conditions, such as a disease state or a loss of nutrients which occurs in a state of ischemia, the smooth muscle cells upregulate a new complement of 5-HT receptors [ 33 - 35 ].
These new receptors maybe involved in activation of the ERK, p38 and JNK pathways, but the studies presented here do not directly address this issue.
They do, however, support the conclusion that the 5-HT 2A receptor does not activate the p38 orJNK pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
Methods
Aortic smooth muscle cell culture
Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats by an explant method previously described [ 36 ].
The smooth muscle cells were plated on to P-100's and grown to confluence.
The cells were used between passages 2 and 9.
The cells were positively stained for smooth muscle α-actin (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA; <START:DRUG> fluorescein <END> labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with each new isolation.
Aortic smooth muscle cells experiments
Cells (P-100 plates) were switched to physiological salt solution (4 ml) [consisting of (in mmol/L) NaCI, 103; KCI, 4.7; KH 2 PO 4 , 1.18; MgSO 4 • 7H 2 O, 1.17; CaCl 2 • 2H 2 O, 1.6; NaHCO 3 , 14.9; dextrose, 5.5; and CaNa 2 EDTA, 0.03] for one hour prior to addition of agonist.
At this time, okadaic acid (1 μM), sodium orthovanadate (1 μM) and PD098059 (10 μM) or vehicle (0.1-.5 %DMSO) was added and allowed to equilibrate for one hour.
PD098059, an inhibitor of MEK activation, was included in all experiments, except the ERK activation experiments, to increase the specificity of the phospho-JNK antibody which recognizes the 44 and 42 kDa ERK bands as well as bands at 54 and 46 kDa.
In the presence of PD098059, the bands at 42 and 44 kDa were significantly reduced.
Each dish was incubated with one agonist concentration [5-HT (10 -9 – 10 -5 M), angiotensin II (10 -9 – 10 -5 M) or <START:DRUG> ANISOMYCIN <END> (500 ng/ml [ 37 ])] for thirty minutes.
Plates were placed on ice and incubation buffer aspirated.
Plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing sodium orthovanadate as a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , pH 7.0).
Five hundred microliters of supplemented RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 10 ug/ml <START:DRUG> aprotinin <END> , 10 ug/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) were added to each dish and cells were harvested with a rubber policeman.
Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Protein concentrations of the resulting supernatant were measured using the BSA method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
The gels were also stained with Gel Code Blue ® (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to validate equal loading of protein.
Immunoblotting protocol
Supernatant (4:1 in denaturing loading buffer, boiled 5 minutes) was loaded, separated on 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes.
Membranes were blocked for 3–4 hours in Tris buffer saline + Tween-20 (0.1%; TBS-T) containing 4% chick egg ovalbulmin and 0.025% sodium azide.
Rabbit anti-phospho Erk MAPK (1:5000, Promega, Madison, Wl), rabbit anti-phospho JNK MAPK (1:5000, Promega, Madison Wl), rabbit anti-phospho p38 MAPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), mouse anti-total Erk (1:5000, Zymed, San Francisco, CA) rabbit anti-total JNK MAPK (1:5000, Santa Cruz BioTechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit anti-total p38 MAPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were incubated with blots overnight (4°C).
Following washes, secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase [anti-rabbit (1:2000, Zymed Laboratories, S. San Francisco, CA) or anti-mouse (1:7500, Amersham, Arlington Heights IL)] was added for one hour and incubated with blots at 4°C.
Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed using standard reagents (Amersham Laboratories, Arlington Heights, IL).
Kinase activity assay protocol
Primary vascular smooth muscle cell preparations were treated with agonists as described above.
They were then lysed in a protein kinase lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 1.5 mM MgCI2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 20 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 10% (vol/vol) <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> , 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1 ug/ml pepstatin A1, 1 ug/ml leupeptin, and 1 ug/ml <START:DRUG> aprotinin <END> ].
Equal protein amounts of each cell lysate (usually 100 ug) were incubated for 3 h at 4°C in the presence of purified GST-c-Jun-(1–79) bound to <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> -agarose beads (2.8 ug GST-c-Jun/ul beads) as previously described [ 38 ].
Beads were washed 2 times with HNTG buffer (HEPES 20 mM pH7.5, NaCI 150 mM, Triton X-100 0.10%, <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> 10%) followed by an additional washing with HNTG buffer + 1% bovine <START:DRUG> serum albumin <END> (BSA).
Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded.
The pellets were washed 2 times with HNTG buffer and 2 times with JKAW buffer (HEPES 25 mM, <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> 10%, MgCl 2 20 mM, Na 3 VO 4 0.1 mM, beta-glycerophosphate 12.5 mM, EGTA 0.5 mM, NaF 0.5 mM).
The pellets were then resuspended in 50.5 μl JKAW reaction buffer containing 20 μCi [- 32 P] ATP and 50 μM unlabeled ATP.
After 30 min at 37°C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 ul SDS loading buffer, samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were transferred to stabilized nitrocellulose membranes and the bands corresponding to phosporylated c-Jun were counted by a phosphorimager (Storm model 860, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA).
Data analysis
Cell experiments were performed three or four times with each repetition of the experiment being performed in cells from explants derived from different animals.
Thus, experiments are representative of responses of 3 or 4 different animals.
Unpaired Student's t tests were used where appropriate in comparing two group responses and a one way ANOVA test was used when comparing responses of three or more groups (p < 0.05 considered statistically significant).
Phosphorimager data was captured using Image Quant 5.1 software (Molecular Dynamics, SunnyVale, CA).
Quantitation of all band densities was performed using the public domain NIH Image (v.1.62).
Routine prophylactic antibiotic use in the management of snakebite
Background
Routine antibiotic prophylaxis following snakebite is not recommended but evidence suggests that it may be common practice in Zimbabwe.
This study set out to determine and describe the extent of this practice at Parirenyatwa Hospital, a large teaching hospital in Zimbabwe
Methods
A retrospective case review (1996 to 1999 inclusive) of all cases of snakebite was undertaken at Parirenyatwa Hospital.
Cases with a diagnosis of snakebite, presenting within 24 hours of the bite and with no complications or concurrent illness were defined as "routine prophylactic antibiotic use".
Results
From 78 cases which satisfied the inclusion criteria, 69 (88.5%) received antibiotics.
Ten different antibiotics from 6 different classes were used with penicillins the most commonly prescribed (benzylpenicillin in 29% of cases, alone or in combination).
Over 40% of antibiotics were given parenterally although all patients were conscious on admission.
The total cost of antibiotics used was estimated at US$522.98.
Conclusion
Routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in snakebite at Parirenyatwa Hospital is common practice.
This may highlight the lack of a clearly defined policy leading to wasteful inappropriate antibiotic use which is costly and may promote bacterial antibiotic resistance.
Further work is required to investigate the reasons for this practice and to design appropriate interventions to counter it.
Background
The routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in the management of snakebite has been advocated and recommended by some authors [ 1 ].
This approach has been based largely on sparse and often conflicting evidence concerning the bacterial flora of the oral cavity and venom of snakes [ 2 ] and the assumption that a snakebite would result in soft tissue infection at the bite site.
The snakebite victim's skin and clothing, materials used for first aid treatment, and the hospital environment have also been implicated as other possible sources of bacterial infection [ 2 ].
However, results of studies have failed to show clinical evidence on the benefit of this prophylactic use of antibiotics [ 3 , 4 ] and there is a low incidence of wound infection after snakebite [ 5 ].
In view of this, the routine use of antibiotics is generally not advocated and can be considered inappropriate, save for cases of snakebite associated with local tissue necrosis or gangrene [ 6 , 7 ], abscess formation [ 8 ], or bullae [ 9 ].
This point has been emphasised by previous authors with regard to snakebite in Zimbabwe [ 10 , 11 ] as well as by our national Drug and Toxicology Information Service (DaTIS) [ 12 ].
Studies in Zimbabwe have shown that antibiotics are the most frequently used medication in the management of snakebite [ 11 , 13 , 14 ] with some authors suggesting that in most instances the use of antibiotics for snakebite was inappropriate and irrational [ 11 , 13 , 15 ].
However, none of these studies attempted to establish the extent of routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in snakebite since they did not exclude cases where the antibiotics may have been warranted such as necrotising bite areas, coexisting bacterial infections or local complications of snake venom.
In view of this and because of the financial implications, we studied routine prophylactic antibiotic use in snakebite at one of the largest referral hospitals in the country in order to assess the extent of this practice and to identify which antibiotics are most commonly used.
Methods
A retrospective review of all case notes (including both physician's and nurse's notes) of snakebite was conducted at Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe for the period January 1996 – December 1999 inclusive.
The diagnosis of "snakebite" in all cases was made by emergency department physicians and records were filed whether or not patients were admitted to the hospital.
The case notes were traced using the International Classification of Diseases code 989.5[ 16 ] for poisoning by snake venom or bite.
Inclusion criteria for "routine prophylactic antibiotic use" required that patients presented to the hospital on the day of or the following day to the bite and did not exhibit complications or evidence of necrosis e.g. darkening of the bite site, abscess formation, bullae formation or any other sign of infection which would require antibiotics.
If no abnormalities were mentioned in the case notes it was assumed that none were present.
Any patients presenting more than a day after the snakebite were excluded from the analysis since they were assumed to be seeking treatment because of complications and not due to the bite itself and therefore any therapy given could not be defined as routine.
Data was recorded and assessed on a standard data collection sheet by a clinical toxicologist (DT) from the poisons information centre.
This data included the date that the bite occurred, date that patient presented to the hospital, antibiotic therapy given on admission and/or in the Emergency Department, the presence of coexisting illnesses and/or injuries and any recorded local signs and symptoms at the bite site.
Whilst the hospital computers could select case numbers by ICD-9 code, the laborious nature of locating and browsing records by hand and manpower limitations precluded validation of the data extraction procedure by a second person.
Financial implications
It is the policy of the Pharmacy Department at Parirenyatwa Hospital to supply a full one week course of oral antibiotics to all hospital inpatients for capsules and tablets and a three day course for patients on parenteral antibiotics.
For children, a 100 ml suspension is normally supplied.
An estimate of cost of antibiotics prescribed for adults was calculated based on the retail cost of the drug (wholesale cost + 50%), the defined daily dose (DDD) for the antibiotic and the hospital pharmacy policy of supplying antibiotics.
To estimate the cost of antibiotics prescribed for children (under 12 yrs), it was assumed that the average daily dose was half that of the DDD in adults.
For oral doses, the cost of a 100 ml suspension of the antibiotic was used.
The costs were calculated using prices as valid on 1 st July 2000 and the exchange rate of US$1=Z$38.
Results
A total of 103 cases diagnosed as due to snakebite for the study period were identified.
Nineteen cases were excluded (15 on the basis that they had presented two days or more after the bite, in 3 cases the date of snakebite was not recorded and 1 was excluded as the snake had spat into the patient's eyes and not actually bitten them).
Therefore a total of 84 patients presented either on the day of the bite or on the following day.
Of these, 3 had necrosis and 2 abscess formation at the bite site and were excluded as these symptoms were considered complications warranting antibiotic use and therefore did not warrant "routine prophylactic antibiotic use".
Four cases had a coexisting illness (2 hypertensive, 1 peptic ulcer disease on antacid therapy and 1 with a productive cough on no drugs).
The patient with the productive cough was excluded as this may have warranted antibiotic use.
Details of the excluded patients and the antibiotics they received are shown in Table 1 .
In all, 78 cases satisfied the inclusion criteria (Table 2 ) as potential candidates of routine prophylactic antibiotic use.
Sixty-nine (88.5%) received antibiotics (31 male; the sex of one case not recorded).
The ages in these cases ranged from 5 to 62 years (n = 68; median 21.5 yr) with 14 cases being below the age of 12 years.
All patients were conscious on admission.
The length of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 16 days (n = 68; median 2.5 days).
Only two patients received antivenin of which one also received an antibiotic (amoxycillin orally).
No culture and sensitivity tests were done before instituting the antibiotic therapy in any of the cases and there were no fatalities in the series.
Antibiotics utilised
A total of 10 different types of antibiotics (from 6 classes namely, penicillins, macrolides, chloramphenicols, aminoglycosides, lincosamides and nitro-imidazoles) were used (Table 3 ).
Penicillins were the most frequently used antibiotics (76.6% of all antibiotics used) with benzylpenicillin being the most widely prescribed (29.0% of all cases) either alone or in combination (Tables 3 and 4 ).
A large proportion of the antibiotics utilised (42.2%) were given parenterally and 37.4% were broad-spectrum antibiotics (Table 3 ).

The total cost of antibiotics for adult patients was calculated to be Z$3525.84 for oral and Z$12285.07 for parenteral preparations.
The cost of antibiotic therapy in paediatric patients was Z$933.36 for oral and Z$3128.69 for parenteral doses.
The total cost of antibiotics used was therefore estimated to be Z$19872.96 (US$522.98).
Discussion
Venomous snakes in Zimbabwe fall into four main families namely elapidae (cobras and mambas), colubridae (boomslang), viperidae (adders or vipers) and atractaspididae (asps) and have been extensively described elsewhere in the literature [ 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 ].
It is claimed that, of the venomous snakes, cytotoxic adder bites e.g. puff adder ( Bitis spp.) are the most common, followed by neurotoxic cobra ( Naja spp.) and mamba ( Dendroasapis spp.) bites with haemotoxic boomslang ( Dispholidus typus ) bites rarely seen[ 13 ], a large number of non-venomous snakes also abound which may be responsible for bites.
The incidence of non-venomous bites and/or "dry" bites by venomous snakes is taken to be high in the catchment area of Parirenyatwa Hospital, an assumption supported by the fact that only two cases received antivenin in this series.
Despite the availability of information on dangerous snakes in Zimbabwe, those responsible for the greater proportion of bites are seldom identified by health care professionals.
This can be attributed to the fact that most bites occur in the night when visibility is low.
In addition, even if the culprit snake is seen, patients presenting to health facilities are seldom able to identify it, and rarely bring dead snakes along with them.
Treatment of snakebite at health care facilities in Zimbabwe is therefore nearly always based on presenting clinical signs and symptoms.
Whilst this study was set out to examine and describe the extent of routine prophylactic antibiotic use in snakebite, it is useful to consider those situations in which antibiotic use is appropriate.
Necrosis at the snakebite area provides an ideal setting for the proliferation of micro-organisms, a situation which may be worsened by the use of a tourniquet [ 2 , 17 ].
However, bacterial infection is not always present at the necrotised snakebite site as evidenced by the absence of bacterial growth from necrosis due to bites from the Southern African puff adder ( Bitis arietans ) and rhombic nightadder ( Caucus rhombeatus ) [ 7 ].
Moreover, cultures of the oral cavities and venoms of different snakes [ 1 , 2 , 18 ], and swabs from necrotic bite sites and abscesses have shown a wide variety of both aerobic (Gram positive and Gram negative) and anaerobic bacteria including Clostridium spp [ 3 , 7 , 8 , 17 , 19 ].
In view of this, antibiotic therapy after necrosis should be based on cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing, a point which has been stressed by other workers [ 2 , 20 ].
The 3 patients (excluded from the analysis) who presented with necrosis in the present study all received empiric antibiotic therapy and no culture and sensitivity tests were done despite the availability of facilities to carry these tests out at the hospital.
It has been suggested that if antibiotics are to be used prophylactically for snakebite in Southern Africa, then Gram-negative aerobic Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp.
must be covered [ 7 ].
However since the range of bacteria from the venom and oral cavities of snakes vary with geographic area, the species and oral health of the snake [ 21 ], this cannot be easily extrapolated to snakes in Zimbabwe.
Moreover, the "blind" use of antibiotics covering such a broad spectrum of activity may promote the emergence of antibacterial drug resistance.
Bacteria are a major cause of abscess formation but the role of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent their formation is questionable [ 22 ].
Proteolytic effects of some snake venoms may cause local reactions that also have a role to play in the pathogenesis of abscess formation [ 8 ].
The two patients (excluded) who presented with abscess formation both received antibiotics.
The use of antibiotics may prevent dissemination of the infection and accelerate healing [ 8 ].
However, as in the case of suspected infection of necrotic areas and for the same reasons, it is desirable to perform culture and sensitivity tests before commencing antibiotic therapy.
There is little clinical evidence of the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics after snakebite [ 3 - 5 ] and the routine use of antibiotics is not advocated except for cases of snakebite associated with complications or signs of infection [ 6 - 9 ].
In the present study, well over three quarters of patients received routine prophylactic antibiotic therapy (88.5%).
The reason for this may be attributed to genuine concern over the occurrence of tissue infection after snakebite even where no local complications due to the venom or otherwise are present.
However, it is also possible that antibiotics are given to patients simply as a form of reassurance to make the patients believe that they were receiving proper treatment.
The relatively large proportion of patients (42.2%) who received parenteral antibiotics despite all patients being conscious on admission may support this speculation since injections may be viewed as superior treatment than oral medicines in some cultures [ 23 ].
The fact that both patients who received antivenin did not receive parenteral preparations suggests this may be an important consideration.
The use of antibiotics for the purposes of prophylaxis against infection accounts for most misuse of these drugs.
Zimbabwe is a developing country with limited medical and financial resources, and rational use of drugs is promoted in the National Drug Policy [ 24 ] in order to better manage these resources.
Routine prophylactic antibiotic use for snakebite should therefore be limited only to cases where they are truly needed as documented in the literature [ 4 , 7 - 9 ].
Using antibiotics routinely for snakebite is not cost effective and puts undue financial pressure on patients who have to pay for antibiotics they do not really need.
This is more so with the routine use of parenteral antibiotics which are generally more costly (exemplified by our results) and carry risks inherent to invasive procedures.
In this study, we estimated the total cost of the drugs to the patient to be US$522.
This is an underestimate of the actual costs of antibiotic therapy as it excludes syringes, needles, health worker time and similar costs and ignores devaluation and depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar between 1996 and 2000.
Moreover, the emergence of antibiotic resistance is primarily due to excessive and often unnecessary use of antibiotics in humans and animals[ 25 ], high routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in snakebite as demonstrated in this study may therefore lead to antibiotic resistance with implications on the use of these drugs in conditions where they are truly needed.
Although the number of cases in this series was relatively small and may not impact significantly on antibiotic resistance in itself, when looking at the problem from a national view point and taking into consideration hospitals at lower levels of care e.g. district hospitals, this may still be an relevant concern.
The wide variety of antibiotics used routinely at the study hospital is also of concern.
A previous retrospective study at six referral hospitals also demonstrated that an array of antibiotics were used in the management of snakebite in Zimbabwe [ 13 ].
Studies from other regions of the world do not appear to follow the same pattern.
These include the Asir region of Saudi Arabia and Eastern Ecuador for instance where only <START:DRUG> ampicillin <END> alone or in combination with another antibiotic were used for snakebite[ 3 , 26 ] This variety in antibiotic prescribing for snakebite in Zimbabwe indicates the lack of a clearly defined policy with regards to this issue.
Taken together with the high use of broad spectrum antibiotics (especially amoxycillin and <START:DRUG> ampicillin <END> ), it also demonstrates a lack of knowledge with regards to which pathogenic bacteria exist in the oral cavities of snakes in the region and in what instances infection is most likely to occur.
Overuse of broad spectrum antibiotics especially where they are really not required is irrational and has been cited as a major reason for the growing world-wide resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.
[ 27 ] Whilst a large number of broad spectrum antibiotics were used, it is interesting to note that benzylpenicillin alone was the most widely used antibiotic at the study hospital, something which has been reported at other referral hospitals in Zimbabwe [ 4 , 28 ].
It is possible that the antibiotic is preferred due to its parenteral route of administration and relative safety as compared to other injectable antibiotics.
It is also possible that this narrow spectrum antibiotic was favoured by some prescribers because of concern about promoting drug resistance by using broad spectrum agents.
The definition of "routine prophylactic antibiotic use" in the present study was based mainly on retrospective assessment of recorded local clinical signs and symptoms, a methodology which has inherent weaknesses.
Since health workers at the time were not aware of the study, records may be incomplete with some observations not being included in patient notes.
Thus there may have been omission of important local clinical signs from the records and if no abnormalities were recorded it was assumed there were none.
Furthermore, swelling, regardless of severity, was not considered as one of the local clinical signs warranting the use of antibiotics and could have excluded true bacterial cellulitis without sepsis.
However, this bias was reduced by excluding all cases presenting more than a day after the snakebite.
Excluding patients presenting a day after the bite may have further reduced this bias, but this would have resulted in us missing bites which occurred in the night and where the patient presented to the hospital the next morning – most snakebites are reported to occur in the later hours of the day in Zimbabwe [ 4 , 11 ].
Pyrexia, was also not considered as one of the clinical presentations warranting the use of antibiotics.
This was in view of the fact that despite reports of bacteria in snake venom[ 2 ] which would lead to systemic infection, it is in fact sterile like other body fluids [ 9 , 18 ].
Some authors have even suggested that some snake venoms may possess antibacterial properties [ 7 , 29 ].
Pyrexia after snakebite is said to be rarely due to sepsis [ 15 ] and is more likely to be a consequence of the venom itself rather than systemic infection.
However, by excluding fever, we may have missed some infections.
Each of these limitations alone or in combination could lead to over-estimation of prophylactic antibiotic use since there may have been additional cases which required antibiotics.
However, they are unlikely to explain the high antibiotic prescribing observed.
There may also have been misclassification of records i.e. some cases of snakebite not being filed under the relevant ICD-9 code which was used to locate the case notes.
Ideally, the extraction procedure could have been validated by browsing all patient records over a set time period to observe that all snakebite cases were filed appropriately.
However, the hospital computer system does not offer simple search and browse methods – once a record number is identified it has to be located physically and browsed by hand.
The logistics of this and limitations in manpower made validation unrealistic.
However, even if some cases of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in snakebite were missed, this does not reduce the importance of the findings.
Conclusions
Routine prophylactic use of antibiotics in the management of snakebite is common at Parirenyatwa Hospital.
This is probably as a consequence of the lack of a clearly defined policy with regards to the exact role of antibiotics in the management of snakebite in Zimbabwe.
This practice may lead to wastage of medical resources and put undue financial pressure on the patient who has to purchase unnecessary drugs.
This is especially pertinent in developing countries such as Zimbabwe.
Furthermore, culture and sensitivity tests should be performed before commencing therapy since bacterial flora in snakes vary greatly, there are chances that necrotic areas may not get infected, and the antibiotics are not being used in life-saving situations.
This will reduce overuse of these drugs with implications for the emergence of bacterial drug resistance and adverse reactions in patients.
Educational and/or managerial interventions are required to address this situation, but these will need to be complemented by an assessment of the motivations underlying the prescribing habits observed.
We trust that this work will also serve as the basis for follow up studies investigating the impact of guidelines on the use of antibiotics in snakebite and to prospective studies of the effect of antibiotics on infection following snakebite.

Minipig cytochrome P450 3A , 2A and 2C enzymes have similar properties to human analogs
Background
The search for an optimal experimental model in pharmacology is recently focused on (mini)pigs as they seem not only to be an alternative source of cells and tissues for xenotherapy but also an alternative species for studies on drug metabolism in man due to similarities between (mini) pig and human drug metabolizing systems.
The purpose of this work is to characterize minipig liver microsomal cytochromes P450 (CYPs) by comparing their N-terminal sequences with corresponding human orthologs.
Results
The microsomal CYPs exhibit similar activities to their human orthologous enzymes (CYP3A4, <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation; 2A6, coumarin 7-hydroxylation; 2D6, <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation; 2E1, p -nitrophenol hydroxylation; and 2C9, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation).
Specific minipig CYP (2A, 2C and 3A) enzymes were partially purified and proteins identified by immunostaining (using antibodies against the respective human CYPs) were used for N-terminal amino acid sequencing.
From comparisons, it can be concluded that the sequence of the first 20 amino acids at the N-terminus of minipig CYP2A is highly similar to human CYP2A6 (70% identity).
The N-terminal sequence of CYP2C shared about 50% similarity with human 2C9.
The results on the minipig liver microsomal CYP3A yielded identical data with those obtained for amino acid sequences of the pig CYP3A29 showing 60% identity with human CYP3A4.
Conclusions
Thus, our results further support the view that minipigs may serve as model animals in pharmacological/toxicological studies with substrates of human CYP enzymes, namely, of the CYP3A and CYP2A forms.
Background
Cytochromes P450 (EC 1.14.14.1, CYP) enzymes are known to metabolize the majority of drugs, to detoxify environmental pollutants as well as to activate some classes of carcinogens as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or nitrosamines [ 1 - 3 ].
Detoxifying systems of minipig and pig liver have recently attracted considerable attention [ 4 - 8 ] as the minipig and pig liver and hepatocytes are believed to be a possible solution for construction of bioartificial liver devices designed to overcome the shortage of human organs for transplantation [ 7 , 9 ].
Moreover, pigs and especially minipigs might be good model species for general studies in pharmacology and toxicology without the need to induce biotransformation enzymes [ 10 ].
Minipig and pig liver have been shown to express the main biotransformation enzymes in amounts and activities comparable to their human counterparts [ 4 , 6 - 8 , 11 ].
Three cDNA clones from a porcine small intestine cDNA library were identified as transcripts of three members of porcine CYP gene subfamily, CYP2D25, CYP3A29, and truncated CYP2C42; the fourth cDNA clone appeared to encode a putative CYP2C pseudogene [ 12 , 13 ].
An advantage of the minipig is that it is apparently close to the conventional pig and, hence, the properties of the drug metabolizing systems should be very similar.
In our previous work, we have found CYP1A, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2E, and 3A marker activities in minipig liver microsomes by testing the respective specific substrates for human CYP enzymes [ 4 ].
In this paper, we report the results of the isolation and characterisation of the first three CYP enzymes from minipig liver microsomal fraction belonging according to their activities as well as to their N-terminal amino acid residues to the CYP2A, CYP2C, and CYP3A subfamilies.
Results and discussion
The microsomal fraction of minipig liver homogenate has been shown to contain the activities characteristic of human CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation), 2A6 (coumarin 7-hydroxylation), 2D6 ( <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation), 2E1 ( <START:DRUG> p-Nitrophenol <END> hydroxylation), and 2C9 ( <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation) [ 4 ].
The presence of these CYP enzymes in minipig microsomes was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the respective human P450 enzymes (results not shown).
These results have confirmed our earlier finding [ 4 ] as well as the results of other authors on pig [ 6 , 7 , 14 ] and minipig liver microsomal systems [ 8 , 15 ].
The isolation procedure led to fractions containing partially purified CYP enzymes in which the specific activities of CYP3A and 2A forms were detected, the activity of the CYP2C enzyme in the partially purified sample was not estimated as it has been consumed by experiments aimed at characterisation of selected proteins.
The main purpose of this work was to obtain partially purified preparations, confirm the presence of selected CYP protein forms in them and with help of electrophoresis and immunoblotting to detect the corresponding CYP proteins.
Subsequently, to use the identified CYP forms for N-terminal protein sequencing.
Specific minipig CYP enzymes in the enriched fractions were visualised by immunostaining with cross-reacting polyclonal antibodies raised against particular human CYP enzymes (Fig. 1A,B,C ).
The bands on the blots stained for total protein by Coomassie Blue R-250 corresponding by their position to migration of purified human isoforms and yielding also the bands by immunostaining, in other words, identified this way to correspond to the respective human enzyme, were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing.
This approach allowed identification of the first 20 amino acids from N-terminus of minipig CYP corresponding to human CYP2A6, 18 amino acids from N-terminus of minipig CYP corresponding to human CYP2C9, and 20 amino acids from N-terminus of minipig CYP corresponding to human CYP3A4.
N-Terminal amino acid sequences or 5'-end cDNA sequences of pig or minipig CYP2A and CYP2C have not been published to date, therefore, we compared our results directly with the known human CYP2A6 and 2C9 sequences (Table 1 ).
Immunoblotting of enriched samples of minipig CYPs Lane 1: 1 pmol of the respective CYP standard; lanes 2 and 3: CYP3A-rich fractions, 5 pmol; lanes 4 and 5: CYP2A- and 2C-rich fractions, 12.5 pmol applied per lane onto 8% gel.
Blot development: A – 100 μg of anti 2A6 IgG; B – 50 μg of anti 2C9 IgG; C – 50 μg of anti 3A4 IgG.
From this comparison it can be concluded that the N-terminus of minipig CYP2A is highly similar to human CYP2A6 (14 of 20 amino acids identical).
Comparison of CYP2C family members may be quite difficult because of very high content of Leu at the N-terminus of the sequenced minipig protein (still about 50% sequence identity with the human counterpart, Table 1 ).
Moreover, the human CYP2C subfamily has at least four highly homologous clones (sequence identity at the N-terminus > 90%), and therefore the existence of other CYP2C-related genes in the minipig may be anticipated.
This problem may hamper further attempts to identify minipig CYP2C proteins with the approach we have used.
cDNA cloning should help to answer this question much better.
The protein sequence of another CYP protein present in the sample matched very well the N-terminal amino acid sequence deduced from published cDNA for pig CYP3A29 (Table 1 , data from [ 13 ]).
The pig/minipig CYP3A and human CYP3A4 shared about 60% sequence similarity (12 of 20 amino acids identical).
The presence of a minipig liver CYP3A enzyme with similar activities to the human CYP3A4 has been reported earlier [ 4 ].
Together with the data obtained with pig liver and intestinal microsomal systems [ 16 - 18 ], the results support the suitability of pigs/minipigs for modeling the biotransformation of drugs in man.
From our results it seems that pigs and minipigs have CYP2A, 2C, and 3A liver microsomal enzymes with very similar N-terminal sequences to the human enzymes.
This finding may be important for pharmacological and toxicological studies because i) CYP3A, 2C and 2A enzymes metabolize many known industrial chemicals and drugs in human use and ii) minipigs in pharmacology/toxicology are much easier to handle than conventional pigs as model animals.
The observed high similarities of N-terminal sequences of minipig and human CYP2A and 2C confirm the previously published similarity in marker activities [ 4 , 8 ].
Conclusions
The results presented in this study support the use of minipigs as experimental animals to predict biotransformation pathways in man and should stimulate further research on similarity of structure and substrate specificity of individual human and (mini)pig CYP enzymes.
The conclusions then obtained may in future bring justification for the use of pig hepatocytes and liver for extracorporeal detoxification and xenotransplantation.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
All reagents and chromatographic materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Prague, CR) if not stated otherwise and were of the analytical grade purity.
DEAE Sephacel was product of Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).
Polyclonal rabbit anti-CYP2A6, anti-CYP2C9, and anti-CYP3A4 IgG were prepared as described elsewhere [ 19 ].
Human recombinant CYP2A6, 2C9, and 3A4 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously [ 20 - 22 ] and used as standards.
Purification of minipig enzymes
Microsomal fractions of liver homogenates were prepared from minipig livers (Brno white variety of Goettingen minipig, Research Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Brno, CR, 25–30 kg body weight, male castrates, N = 5, age 6 months).
No induction protocols were applied to minipigs.
The preparation of microsomes was done according to standard procedure [ 23 ].
Separation of CYP enzymes from cholate-solubilized microsomal fraction was based in general on the procedure developed earlier [ 24 , 25 ].
Solubilized microsomes were applied to an octyl-Sepharose column where the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was eluted first during the wash with equilibration buffer (buffer A, 0.1 M K/PO 4 , pH 7.25, 1 mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> , 0.6% (w/v) cholate), in which the cholate concentration was reduced to 0.42%.
A sharp peak containing cytochrome b 5 together with CYP3A was eluted when the concentration of cholate was further lowered to 0.33% and 0.06% (w/v) Triton N-101 was added to buffer A. The next fractions eluted after CYP3A and cytochrome b 5 appeared to contain mainly the CYP2C and CYP2D enzymes.
Lastly, the fractions with CYP2A were eluted.
CYP3A was separated from cytochrome b 5 by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephacel equilibrated with buffer B: 5 mM K/PO 4 , pH 7.7, containing 0.1 mM EDTA, 20% <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> (v/v), and 0.2% sodium cholate (w/v).
Increasing the cholate concentration to 0.5% along with addition of 0.2% Triton N-101 (w/v) resulted in elution of the CYP containing peak.
Impure fractions containing CYP were dialyzed overnight against 10 mM <START:DRUG> potassium <END> phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% <START:DRUG> glycerol <END> (v/v) and further purified by chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the same buffer.
Extensive washing was done to remove Triton N-101.
CYP was eluted using a linear gradient of phosphate, from 10 mM to 500 mM.
The hydroxylapatite chromatography was repeated to further purify the CYP enzyme fractions prior to immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing.
Activity assays
The results of activity assays are displayed in Table 2 .
 <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation was followed to characterize the CYP3A enzyme activity according to [ 26 ].
Oxidation of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> was determined in microsomes as well as in fractions after chromatography.
In this case, a reconstituted system including 200 pmol of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (PanVera, Madison, WI) was used with a procedure described previously [ 21 ].
Coumarin 7-hydroxylation was followed to estimate the CYP2A activity [ 27 ].
To monitor the activity of CYP2C enzyme(s), in microsomal faction, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation was determined [ 28 ].
The determination of activities in fractions containing partially purified CYP enzymes was done in systems mimicking the original microsomal preparations with addition of components lost during the process of purification of CYP enzymes (NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase, cytochrome b 5 , phospholipid).
The method was based on general approach described by Shimada and Yamazaki [ 29 ].
Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
SDS electrophoresis was done in 10% and 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli [ 30 ] using a MiniProtean apparatus (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Protein staining was done with Coomassie Blue R-250 [ 31 ] and immunoblotting was performed as described [ 32 ] using the described conditions for development of blots [ 19 ].
Polyclonal anti-human CYP2A6, 2C9 and 3A4 IgG were used.
Amino acid sequencing
N-Terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using Procise Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and methodology based on Edman degradation.
SDS electrophoresis, transfer of protein to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.
Bedford, MA), and staining methods are described elsewhere [ 19 ].
Yields at each cycle were estimated by comparison with external standards.
Receptorphin: A conserved peptide derived from the sequence of the opioid receptor , with opioid displacement activity and potent antiproliferative actions in tumor cells
Background
In addition to endogenous opioids, a number of peptide sequences, derived from endogenous (hemorphins, alphaS1-casomorphin), and exogenous proteins (casomorphins, exorphins) have been reported, possessing opioid activity.
In the present work, we report the identification of a new peptide, receptorphin (Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu), derived from the sequence of the second transmembrane loop of the opioid receptor.
This sequence is unique for the opioid receptor, and conserved in all species and receptor-types.
Results and Discussion
Receptorphin competes for opioid binding, presenting a kappa-receptor interaction, while it binds equally to delta- and mu- opioid and somatostatin-binding sites, and inhibits the cell proliferation of a number of human cancer cell lines, in a dose-dependent and reversible manner, at the picomolar or the nanomolar range.
Receptorphin shows a preferential action on prostate cancer cells.
Conclusion
Our work identifies, for the first time a peptide, in a receptor sequence, possessing ligand-agonistic activities.
A hypothesis, based on receptorphin liberation after cell death, is presented, which could tentatively explain the time-lag observed during opioid antiproliferative action.
Background
Endogenous opioids derive from three main precursor proteins, namely proenkephalin A, proenkephalin B or prodynorphin and proopiomelanocortin (POMC), through alternative post-translational processing.
These three precursor proteins give rise to at least seven endogenous opioid peptides [ 1 ].
All these peptides usually have a very brief half-life, with the exception of beta-endorphin, and therefore it is believed to act locally.
Opioid binding sites, characterized pharmacologically, belong to three main categories, namely delta, mu and kappa.
Different subtypes at each opioid site were equally reported (δ 1 , δ 2 , μ 1 , μ 2 , κ 1 , κ 2 , κ 3 ).
A differential distribution of each opioid site was found in the central and the peripheral nervous system [ 2 ], while each endogenous opioid ligand binds with a different selectivity to each site [ 3 , 4 ].
The molecular characterization of opioid receptors was obtained in the '90s.
The cDNA and the aminoacid sequence of the three main opioid receptors was reported, and found to follow the general scheme of the seven loops membrane receptors [ 5 ].
The homology among the reported opioid receptor sequences varies between 50 and 64%.
It is interesting to note that transmembrane and intracellular domains, presents a greater homology (~69%) as compared to that of their extracellular part [ 5 - 7 ].
Opioids interfere with a number of physiological actions in the nervous system, including nociception, cognition, and release of hormones or neurotransmitters.
In addition, a specific modulatory action of opioids was reported in the peripheral nervous system [ 8 , 9 ], and immune-related cells [ 10 - 12 ].
The biological actions of opioids necessitate the presence of opioid receptors, their ligand and the ligand-specific degradation system in the proximity of their site of action.
This is true for the nervous and the immune system, while the hypothalamic-pituitary portal circulation provides opioids to the pituitary gland [ 13 ].
In addition, opioids act in other tissues, and recent reports indicate that these agents possess potent antiproliferative actions in tumor cells [ 14 - 22 ], inducing arrest of cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 23 - 25 ].
β-endorphin, an opioid peptide produced mainly by the pituitary and the immune system, with a sufficiently high biological half-life, and/or locally produced opioids were proposed as potential endogenous opioid mediators of this antiproliferative effect [ 15 , 17 ].
In addition to the endogenous classical opioid peptides, a number of other opioid agonists has been reported, derived from food (exorphins) [ 26 , 27 ], hemoglobin (hemorphins) [ 28 - 31 ] or milk-caseins (casomorphins) [ 16 , 32 - 39 ].
These peptides can also compete for opioid binding, and decrease cell proliferation in different human and animal cell systems, and could be additional sources of locally-acting opioids.
Finally, a number of synthetic peptides, usually produced through combinatorial search of peptide libraries [ 40 , 41 ] have shown an increased affinity for one or multiple opioid binding sites.
In the present work, we report another peptide, derived from the conserved second transmembrane segment of the opioid receptor, with potent antiproliferative activity, in different human cancer cell lines.
Its sequence is Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu.
We named it receptorphin, and we report that it further competes for opioid agonist binding.
Results
Opioid receptor binding selectivity of receptorphin
Figure 1 (upper panel) shows the competition of receptorphin for opioid ligand binding on different sites in the rat brain.
As shown, the peptide displaces radiolabelled DPDPE and DAGO (selective ligands for the delta and mu opioid binding site) in a dose-dependent manner, with IC 50 s of 8.25 × 10 -8 and 1.81 × 10 -7 M respectively.
In addition, [ 3 H]U69-593 was equally displaced by receptorphin from kappa 1 opioid sites.
This peptide competes equally with kappa 3 opioid sites, as [ 3 H] <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> binding, in the presence of micromolar concentrations of DADLE (which masks kappa 2 , delta and mu sites, on which the radioligand could equally bind [ 4 ]) does not modify the competition curves of receptorphin.
The analysis of the binding curves is presented in Table 1 .

Lower panels: T47D cells See text for conditions of binding.
Mean ± SEM of three experiments in duplicate.
Previous results have shown that opioid binding sites could also been identified in a number of breast [ 17 , 19 ] and prostate cell lines [ 38 ].
Binding of opioid agonists on these sites induces a decrease of cell proliferation.
Figure 1 (lower panel) shows the competition of receptorphin for opioid binding on T47D cells.
The interaction of the peptide with the different subtypes of the kappa opioid site was obtained by the use of a combination of radiolabelled ligands (ethylketocyclazocine and <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> ) and effectors (DADLE), as described under Material and Methods.
Receptorphin competes for binding to kappa opioid sites, with a very high affinity, presenting in this cell line too a main interaction with kappa 1 and kappa 3 subtypes, as microsomal concentrations of DADLE do not modify substantially opioid binding.
The interaction of receptorphin with delta and mu sites in T47D cells was inexistant, due to the minimal number of these sites in T47D cells.
In contrast, receptorphin displaces [ 3 H]DPDPE and [ 3 H]DAGO, in MCF7 cells, bearing delta and mu binding sites.
A summary of the interaction of receptorphin with opioid sites in other cell lines is presented in Table 1 .
Cell proliferation
The above results indicate that receptorphin competes for opioid binding on human breast and prostate cancer cells, bearing opioid receptors.
A main effect of opioid ligands in these cancer cell lines is the decrease of cell proliferation [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 38 ].
We have therefore examined the antiproliferative action of receptorphin, in the same cell lines.
Figure 2 and Table 2 present the effect of receptorphin on the proliferation of breast (MCF7 and T47D) and prostate cancer derived cell lines (PC3 and DU145).
As shown, this peptide, at concentrations ranging from 10 -12 to 10 -6 M inhibits cell proliferation of breast (MCF7 and T47D) and prostate (DU145, PC3) cell lines by 41, 49, 59 and 27% respectively.
IC 50 was 0.15, 0.07, 0.44 and 6.98 nM respectively.
The general opioid antagonist diprenorphin (10 -6 M) shifted the effect of receptorphin by one log in breast cancer cell lines, while its action was much more pronounced in DU145 and PC3 cancer cell lines, indicating that opioid antagonists reverse, at least partially the antiproliferative effect of the peptide.
In contrast, the selective kappa 1 antagonist Nor-Binaltorphine (NorBNI) (10 -6 M) produced only a partial inhibition of receptorphin binding.
This result indicates that receptorphin might interact equally with other sites, different from classical opioid receptors.
Effect of receptorphin on the proliferation of breast (MCF7, T47D) and prostate (DU145, PC3) human cancer cell lines.
Cells were plated at an initial density of 20000 cells/well, and the effect of the peptide (changed every day) was assayed after two cell cycles (4 th day).
The number of cells therefore, in control conditions (in the absence of the peptide) was 80000/well.
Cell viability was in all cases >95%.
Diprenorphin was added simultaneously with receptorphin, at a concentration of 10 -6 M. Mean ± SEM of three different experiments performed in triplicate.
Interaction of receptorphin with other membrane receptor systems
As presented in Figure 2 , the addition of the general opioid antagonist <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> in the culture medium decreases, but does not abolish the antiproliferative effect of receptorphin.
This result could suggest a possible interaction of the peptide with other membrane sites, different from opioid binding sites.
A similar result was equally onserved with a number of casomorphins, in the same cell lines [ 16 , 38 ].
Further analysis has revealed an interaction of casomorphins with somatostatin binding sites [ 16 , 38 , 42 ].
In order to identify a possible interaction of receptorphin with somatostatin sites, we have used the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, which, according to our previous results does not express opioid binding sites [ 38 ].
Our results are shown in Figure 3 .
Receptorphin inhibited cell growth by 60%, with an IC 50 of 87 nM, significantly higher than that observed for other cell lines.
In this particular case, <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> (10 -6 M) enhanced rather than inhibited the antiproliferative effect by a factor of 30 (IC 50 2.8 nM), indicating that other membrane receptor systems might be also implicated in the action of the peptide.
Competition of receptorphin for [ 125 I]Tyr 11 -somatostatin14 binding revealed that the peptide could decrease somatostatin binding with an IC 50 of 18.9 ± 1.02 × 10 -9 M, comparable with the antiproliferative effect of the peptide on LNCaP cells, indicating a significant interaction of receptorphin with somatostatin receptors.

T47D cells were plated at an initial density of 20000 cells/well, and the effect of the peptide (changed every day) was assayed after two cell cycles (4 th day).
The number of cells therefore, in control conditions (in the absence of the peptide) was 80000/well.
Cell viability was in all cases >95%.
Diprenorphin (A) or NorBNI (B) were added simultaneously with receptorphin, at a concentration of 10 -6 M. Mean ± SEM of three different experiments performed in triplicate.
Discussion
In recent years, a number of endogenous and food-derived proteins have been identified as potential sources of opioid or opiomimetic peptides.
They include gluten, hemoglobin and caseins [ 26 , 27 , 32 - 37 , 39 ].
By limited proteolysis of such proteins, a number of peptides have been identified, which presents features of opiomimetic action: binding to opioid receptors, competition for opioid ligands, opiomimetic effects, and reversion of their action by the addition of opioid antagonists.
These opioid peptide sources could resolve the problem of opioid availability in organs, in which classical opioid precursor were not identified.
Indeed, the blood flow disposition of endogenous opioid peptides is limited, due to the very short half-life of these peptides, with the exception of beta-endorphin.
The results of the present investigation identify another peptide, receptorphin, derived from the opioid receptor itself.
Receptorphin sequence is comprised to the conserved structure of the second transmembrane segment of the opioid receptor (see Table 3 and Figure 5 ).
Receptorphin exhibits some characteristics of an opioid ligand:

Alignment of the sequences of the second transmembrane loop of different opioid receptors.
Sequences are derived from references in Table 3 .
The sequence of receptorphin is indicated in bold letters.
1.
It competes for opioid ligand binding on opioid sites, exhibiting principally selectivity for kappa opioid receptors (especially kappa 1 and kappa 3 ).
Its affinity, in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, is higher than that of the prototype ligands [ 14 , 17 , 19 ].
In contrast, in rat brain membranes, the affinity of receptorphin is lower than that of DAGO or DPDPE.
It is not actually known whether this discrepancy is due to the difference of normal and neoplastic tissue, in which a possible alternative splicing of the opioid receptor could occur, to the conditions of binding (hypotonic medium in rat brain as compared to isotonic medium in whole cell binding) or to species differences.
A similar discrepancy was also observed in the case of αS1-casomorphin and other casomorphin peptides [ 16 , 37 , 38 ].
In addition, receptorphin interacts with somatostatin binding, a result explaining the non-complete reversion of its effect by opioid antagonists.
A similar interaction was equally observed with a number of other food-derived peptides, in the same system [ 16 , 38 ].
2.
Receptorphin decreases cell proliferation in different breast and prostate cell lines, in a dose-dependent and reversible manner, as reported for other opioid alkaloids and casomorphin ligands [ 16 , 17 , 38 ].
Comparing the IC 50 of receptorphin with that obtained in the same cell lines by a number of other opioid peptides [ 16 , 37 , 38 ] it is derived that this new opioid agonist is almost as potent as alpha S1 -casomorphin in the prostate, while it is much less potent (at least by a factor of 20) in the breast.
Comparable maximal inhibition of growth was obtained by receptorphin and other casomorphin peptides, both in the breast and the prostate [ 16 , 38 ], representing possibly, the maximum opioid-related effect on these cell lines.
The physiological relevance of this prostate selectivity of receptorphin is not known.
The above results are, of course, not enough to characterize fully a possible new opioid peptide.
Further work, implying more classical opioid effects in cells (GTP binding, cAMP inhibition) and organs or animals might be necessary for the complete identification of receptorphin as an opioid agonist.
Nevertheless, the fact that receptorphin binds with a high affinity to opioid sites in different organs (brain and cancer cell lines) in which opioid receptors were identified, and its antiproliferative action in different cancer cell lines is inhibited by the general opioid antagonist <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> apply for an opioid activity of this peptide.
The sequence of receptorphin (Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu) is conserved in all reported opioid receptors, from a variety of species (Table 3 ).
In contrast, this sequence is restricted to the opioid receptor, and is not detected in other seven-loop membrane receptors [ 43 ].
It is interesting that, at the same position (second transmembrane segment) of the different types of the somatostatin receptor (SSTR-1 to 5) which present the greater homology with opioid receptors [ 5 ], in different species, a peptide with the sequence Tyr-Ile(or-Leu)-Leu-Asn-Leu exists, presenting an homology in structure with receptorphin [ 44 - 48 ].
Furthermore, two or three amino acids of receptorphin (Phe-Asn-Leu) interfere with the agonist or antagonist binding, at least indirectly, participating in the formation of the ligand envelope [ 43 ].
This might be the reason of the conservation of the receptorphin sequence in all opioid receptor sequences (Table 3 ).
Comparing receptorphin (Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu) with other opioid peptides, it is observed that it shares Tyr at position 1 and Leu in position 5.
In contrast, the presence of Ile and Asn at positions 2 and 4 and the non-classical Phe at position 3 are unique in receptorphin.
This non-classical amino-acid composition may confer the described binding characteristics to this new peptide (Table 1 ), which bears the classical pharmacophoric groups of classical opioid agonists (Tyr, Phe, Leu).
Conclusions
In the present paper, we report the identification of a ligand-specific peptide, in the sequence of its cognitive receptor structure.
Receptorphin (Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu) has a unique sequence, conserved in all opioid receptor types and species.
The peptide competes with a high affinity for opioid binding, showing a preferential interaction with kappa (κ 1 and κ 3 ), while it competes with delta, mu, and somatostatin sites with a lower affinity.
It can therefore be considered as a non-selective opioid ligand.
Although this finding is interesting per se, the current knowledge permits only speculations about a possible biological role of the peptide, if any.
Receptorphin is flagged by Ile at position -1 and always by Ala at position 6 (see Figure 5 ), making it a putative target of peptidases, while its location, in the hydrophobic membrane environment, protects it from a possible hydrolytic-enzyme action.
A possible hypothesis could be that receptorphin might act as an opioid peptide after cell death.
In this case, after intra- and extracellular domains of opioid receptor destruction by different liberated proteolytic enzymes, and rupture of the membrane structure, the leading Ile -1 of receptorphin could be cleaved by exopeptidases, while the following Ala 6 might be removed by basic endopeptidases, leading to the liberation of the active peptide.
If such a mechanism occurs, opioid action could be potentiated after an opioid- and/or other inducers-related cell death.
Indeed, it is tentative to assume that after an opioid mediated cellular death [ 23 - 25 ], receptorphin liberation might trigger a positive feedback loop, propagating the opioid effects to a number of adjacent opioid receptor-positive cells.
This mechanism could possibly explain the time-lag found in opioid-related cell proliferation and apoptosis, reported in a number of malignant cell lines [ 15 - 17 , 37 , 38 ].
Nevertheless, this putative receptorphin implication in cell proliferation remains highly speculative, until its presence could be detected in cell cultures.
In addition, it might be of interest to detect similar structures in the sequence of other members of the seven-loop superfamily, in order to investigate whether this finding is unique to the opioid receptor itself, or could be extended to its other members.
Methods
Peptide synthesis
Receptorphin (Tyr-Ile-Phe-Asn-Leu) was synthesized by conventional peptide chemistry methods.
t-butoxycarboxyl (Boc) groups were used for protection of the a-amino-groups, while a t-butyl group was used for the protection of the phenolic hydroxy-group.
The dichloro-carbodi-imiole/1-hydroxybenzo-triazo method was used for the coupling of the protected amino acids.
Removal of the t-butyl and Boc groups was achieved by trifluoroacetic acid.
Peptide purification was made by semipreparative HPLC on a reverse phase C-18 Nucleosil column, on a 30 min linear gradient of 15–85% methanol in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid.
Cell lines and culture conditions
Two breast cancer (MCF7 and T47D), and tho prostate cell lines (PC3 and DU145), bearing opioid binding sites [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 38 ], were used, in order to assay the opioid activity of receptorphin.
DU145 and MCF7 cell lines were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), while T47D, and PC3 cells were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK).
T47D and DU145 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS, while, for MCF7 cell culture, DMEM/F12 medium was used, supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, St Louis, MI) and 10% FBS.
All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air.
All culture media were from Gibco BRL (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK).
Medium, supplemented or not with receptorphin, was changed every day.
Without addition of any drug, the proliferation time of all cell lines was two days.
Receptorphin was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline shortly before use.
Cell proliferation
Cells were plated in 24-well plates, at an initial density of 2 × 10 4 cells, with 1.0 ml medium per well.
All drugs were added to cultures one day after seeding (designated as day 0), in order to ensure uniform attachment of cells at the onset of the experiments.
Cell growth was measured by the tetrazolium salt assay [ 49 ].
Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C with the tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), and metabolically active cells reduced the dye to purple formazan.
Dark blue crystals were dissolved with propanol, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm and compared against a standard curve of known numbers of cells.
All experiments were performed, at minimum, three times in triplicate.
Binding conditions
Cancer cell lines
Ligand binding assays on whole cells (10 6 cells/well) were performed as described in Hatzoglou et al [ 14 , 16 , 17 ], in a total volume of 0.5 ml phosphate buffered saline (10 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), containing radioactive opioids or somatostatin, without (total binding), with 10 -5 M of the same unlabelled agent (non specific binding), or with varying concentrations of receptorphin, ranging from 10 -12 to 10 -6 M. Cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (18–22°C).
At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with cold buffer, in order to eliminate the unbound radioactivity.
Cells were removed from plates with 0.4 ml 2N NaOH, mixed with 4 ml scintillation cocktail (SigmaFluor, Sigma, St Louis, MI) and counted in a scintillation counter (Tricarb, Series 4000, Packard), with a 60% efficiency for Tritium, for opioids and in a Tricarb (Packard) gamma counter with a 95% efficiency for [ 125 I] (somatostatin binding).
Binding was repeated three times (in duplicate).
A number of different opioid ligands were used in order to identify specific opioid binding sites.
[ 3 H] [D-Pen 2 , D-Pen 5 ]enkephalin (DPDPE) was used as a selective delta ligand, and [ 3 H] [N-me-Phe 4 , Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAGO) as a selective mu ligand.
[ 3 H]ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) and [ 3 H] <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> were used as general opioid ligands, sharing nevertheless, at nanomolar concentrations, a different receptor recognition spectrum: ethylketocyclazocine recognizes delta, mu, and the kappa 1 and kappa 2 (or epsilon) subtypes of the kappa binding site, while <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> recognizes delta, mu, kappa 2 and kappa 3 sites [ 3 , 4 ].
The addition of micromolar concentrations of DADLE masks the ligand interaction with delta, mu, and kappa 2 opioid sites, permitting the differentiation of the effect of the tracer with the kappa 1 and the kappa 3 opiod site respectively [ 3 , 4 ].
Control experiments, in our laboratory have proven that by the use of these combinations we obtain similar results for the detection of kappa1 and kappa3 opioid sites, as with the use of the selective ligands U50488 and Met 5 -enkephalin-Arg 6 -Phe 7 .
Rat brain membranes
Rat brain membrane preparation and opioid binding was performed as described previously by Loukas et al.
[ 39 ].
Briefly, binding was performed in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4), in a final volume of 1.0 ml.
The protein concentration was 300 μg/assay.
Binding was initiated by the addition of 2 nM of the selective ligand ([ 3 H]DPDPE for δ or [ 3 H]DAGO for μ sites, [ 3 H]U69-593 for kappa 1 site and [ 3 H] <START:DRUG> diprenorphine <END> as a general opioid ligand, as discussed above).
Non specific binding was estimated in the presence of 10 -5 M <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> or diprenorphin.
Peptide concentrations varied from 10 -12 to 10 -6 M. After the incubation, bound radioactivity was separated by filtration, under reduced pressure, through GF/D filters, previously soaked in Tris-HCl buffer, and rinsed twice with ice-cold buffer.
The results of binding assays were analyzed by the Origin (MicroCal, Northampton, MA.) V 5 package, using equations described by Munson and Rodbard [ 50 ].

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists prevent 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced c-jun activation and cell death
Background
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides, the oxygenated derivatives of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> , have been shown to cause programmed cell death in a variety of cell types.
Using N9 microglia, this study was designed to investigate the molecular events induced by <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides prior to the execution of programmed cell death.
Results
Microglia were very sensitive to 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> , such that a 2-day treatment of the cells with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> reduced cell viability to 5–10% of controls.
There was a dose- and time-dependent increase in c-jun and phospho-c-jun levels in microglia prior to this 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cell death.
In contrast, 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> , which was relatively non-toxic to microglia, did not increase phospho-c-jun levels.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptors that have important roles in atherogenesis.
Results from this study indicate that PPAR agonists such as 15d-PGJ 2 , <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> and WY14643 can attenuate <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced c-jun activation and cell death in microglia.
Conclusions
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists may be useful in future development of pharmacological agents against <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced cytotoxicity.
Background
High levels of serum <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> and low density lipoprotein (LDL) have been associated with the genesis of atherosclerosis, a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases that affect a large number of people all over the world.
It has become clear that the pathological conditions associated with an excess level of LDL are actually caused by the oxidized products of LDL [ 1 ].
More specifically, <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides (also termed oxysterols), the oxygenated derivatives of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> , appear to be the major cytotoxic components in oxidized LDL [ 2 , 3 ].
These compounds have a hydroxyl- or a keto- group on the <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> molecule.
Examples of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides include: 7-OH-, 7-keto-, 19-OH-, 22-OH- and 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> (see [ 4 ] for a recent review).
Tissue damage caused by <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides has been the subject of many studies.
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are cytotoxic to a variety of cell types [ 5 ].
These compounds can damage endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, all of which are major components of the arterial wall.
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are also toxic to cells derived from the immune system, such as macrophages, thymocytes, lymphoma cells and leukemic T-cells.
Pharmacological agents capable of reducing <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide toxicity are yet to be discovered.
The mode of cell death caused by <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides has generated much interest recently.
There is evidence showing that programmed cell death (PCD, also known as apoptosis) occurs in some cells treated with <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides [ 6 - 8 ].
PCD is a special type of cell death that can be induced by growth factor deprivation or toxins [ 9 - 11 ].
By using the PCD induced by nerve growth factor deprivation in sympathetic neurons as an example, the cell death process begins with the generation of reactive oxygen species followed by a significant decrease in glucose uptake, RNA and protein synthesis, activation of the immediate early protein, c-jun, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.
Cell death is executed by the activation of a family of proteases termed caspases.
Morphologically, cells dying of PCD appear atrophic and exhibit condensed nuclei, which can be stained with nuclear stains (bisbenzimide or <START:DRUG> propidium <END> iodide), or by the TUNEL assay.
DNA extracted from cells dying of PCD is often fragmented and shows a characteristic ladder-type pattern on the agarose gel upon electrophoresis.
MAP kinases (Mitogen-Activated Protein kinases) have very important roles in PCD.
The MAP kinase pathway consists of 3 major parallel pathways designated as the ERK (p42/44, Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase), SAPK/JNK (p46, Stress-Activated Protein Kinase/ c-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase) and p38 pathways [ 12 - 14 ].
Activation of each pathway above involves phosphorylation of a number of upstream and downstream family members of the pathway.
During growth factor deprivation induced PCD in neuronal PC12 cells, there is a sustained activation of the JNK and p38 pathways while the activities of ERK pathway is inhibited.
It was proposed that a dynamic balance of JNK-p38 and ERK can determine if the neuronal cell will live or die [ 15 ].
Similar interplay of the MAP kinases was shown in the PCD of non-neuronal cells [ 16 ].
It is known that oxidized LDL can cause activation of MAP kinases [ 17 , 18 ].
Whether <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides, the main toxic components in oxidized LDL, can induce MAP kinase activation, and whether MAP kinase activation has a role in <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced PCD remain to be investigated, and is the subject of this study.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to a group of nuclear receptors which includes steroid, retinoid, thyroid hormone receptors and others [ 19 - 21 ].
There are three types of PPARs: PPARα is found predominantly in the liver, heart, kidney, brown adipose and stomach mucosa, and is important for lipid catabolism.
PPARγ is found in adipose tissues, and is important for adipogenesis.
PPARβ is found in most tissues, but its role is less well-defined.
PPARγ is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions [ 22 ] and is important in the process of atherogenesis.
Depending on the experimental system and the particular question asked, PPARγ can be involved with pro-atherogenesis or anti-atherogenesis.
For example, PPARγ is involved in a positive feedback mechanism that induces the formation of foam cells [ 23 ].
On the other hand, activation of PPARγ was shown to inhibit monocyte [ 24 ] and macrophage [ 25 ] inflammatory responses by preventing the activation of nuclear transcription factors, such as NF-kB (nuclear factor-kappa B), AP-1 (activator protein-1) and STAT 1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1).
Since inflammation plays an important role in atherogenesis, this anti-inflammatory effect of PPARγ should help to reduce the risk of atherogenesis.
Development of PPAR agonists that retain the antiatherogenic activity but dismiss the proatherogenic activities will be of great value [ 26 ].
Many naturally occurring or synthetic compounds are agonists for the PPARs [ 20 , 21 ].
For example, a number of prostaglandins are agonists for PPARγ .
The prostaglandin, 15-deoxy-delta 12, 14-PGJ 2 (15d-PGJ 2 ), is the most potent endogenous PPARγ agonist known.
On the other hand, many synthetic compounds such as the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are PPARα and PPARγ agonists [ 27 ].
Since these are agents used clinically for other purposes, it is important to determine whether interaction of these agents with PPARs could modulate atherogenesis in a positive or negative manner.
While most research regarding <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are focused on the cardiovascular system, it should be noted that the nervous tissue has the ability to generate <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides, which may exert toxic effect on cells and tissues of the nervous system.
For example, it has been shown that synaptosomes and mitochondria prepared from CNS tissue can convert <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> to <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides, which may play an important role in brain tissue damage during oxidative stress [ 28 ].
Consistent with this notion, we have shown <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are toxic to neuronal PC12 cells [ 29 , 30 ] and neurons derived from sympathetic ganglia [ 31 ], retina [ 32 ] and cerebellum [ 33 ].
Microglia in the central nervous system express scavenger receptors and are involved in the oxidized LDL uptake and metabolism [ 34 ].
These cells are, thus, the macrophage-equivalent in the central nervous system [ 35 ].
Results from this laboratory showed that <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides can cause programmed cell death in microglia [ 7 ], which suggests that microglia, similar to macrophages, can be a potential target for oxidized LDL toxicity.
Based on the observations that: 1.
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides cause PCD but the involvement of MAP kinases remains to be investigated; 2.
PPARs are important in atherosclerosis but the effect of PPAR activation on <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced PCD has not been determined, this study was designed to test if a dysregulation of MAP kinases was associated with the <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced PCD, and to determine if PPAR activation could modulate the <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced PCD.
Results
Cytotoxicity of 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> toward microglia
A set of dose- and time-response experiments indicated that 5, 10 and 20 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treatment for one day reduced the viability to ~97, 70 and 52% of controls, respectively (Fig. 1 ).
This agent at 5 μM reduced the viability to ~9% of controls after a 2-day treatment.
In contrast, 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> was much less toxic to microglia, such that this agent at 20 μM showed little toxicity to the cells after a 1-day treatment (Fig. 2 ).
A 3-day treatment of the cells with 20 μM 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> reduced the viability to ~81% of controls.
These results confirmed and extended those obtained from our previous study [ 7 ].

Effect of 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> on cell viability.
Microglia were treated with various concentrations of 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> for 1, 2 or 3 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
Results from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 indicated that 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> was more toxic to these cells as compared with 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> .
Activation of c-jun as a result of 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treatment
Because c-jun was shown to play important roles in programmed cell death in many cell types [ 20 , 21 ], and microglia were shown to undergo programmed cell death after <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide treatment [ 7 ], experiments were performed to determine if c-jun activation was involved in <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced microglial cell death.
Cells were treated with 10 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> or 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> for 12 hours, then processed for Western blot analyses.
Antibodies against c-jun, phospho-c-jun (at position serine 63) or ERK 1/2 (an antibody which can recognize both ERK 1 and ERK 2) were used in this set of experiments.
Results indicated that both <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides caused an increase in c-jun in microglia, with 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> showing a more pronounced increase (Fig. 3 ).
Furthermore, 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> caused the phosphorylation of c-jun, a phenomenon not observed in 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treated microglia.
The levels of ERK 1/2 were not altered by either treatment.
These results suggested that c-jun activation was associated with the toxicity of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides.

Concurrent electrophoresis procedures were performed for each antibody.
Results indicated that c-jun activation, i.e., phosphorylation of c-jun, was associated with the toxicity of 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> .
A set of experiments was performed to determine any dose-dependent change in c-jun activation by 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> .
Microglia were treated with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> for 12 hours, then processed for Western blot analysis.
Results indicated that 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treatment led to an increase in c-jun and phospho-c-jun at serine 63.
The levels of ERK 1/2 were not altered by this treatment (Fig. 4 ).

Antibodies against c-jun, phospho-c-jun (at serine 63) and ERK 1/2 were used in this set of experiments.
Concurrent electrophoresis procedures were performed for each antibody.
Results indicated that 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> caused a dose-dependent increase in c-jun activation.
Time-dependent change of MAP kinase activities
Further studies were performed to determine the effect of 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> on different members of MAP kinases.
The time-dependent change in c-jun, ERK and p38 levels was determined.
Cells were treated with 10 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> for 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours, then processed for Western blot analyses.
Results indicated that there was an increase in c-jun after 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treatment between 1–12 hours of treatment.
This protein dropped to a non-detectable level at 24 hours after treatment.
In addition, there was an increase in the levels of phospho-c-jun on the serine residues (at both position 63 and position 73).
The levels of JNK (JNK 1 and JNK 2), however, were not altered (Fig. 5 ).
Time-dependent alterations of MAP kinases activity.
Cells were treated with 10 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours, then processed for Western blot analysis.
Antibodies against c-jun, phospho-c-jun (serine 63 or serine 73), JNK, ERK 1/2, phospho-ERK, p38 and phospho-p38 were used in this series of experiments.
See text for an analysis of the results.
The levels of ERK1/2 were similar during the first 6 hours, then dropped between 12–24 hours after treatment.
The levels of phospho-ERK increased between 1–6 hours after treatment, then decreased to a non-detectable level afterwards (Fig. 5 ).
This decrease in phospho-ERK expression occurred at a time coincided with the appearance of phospho-c-jun.
The changes in p38 or phospho-p38 levels were minimal (Fig. 5 ).
Modulation of c-jun activation by PPAR agonists
It was reported that PPAR activation could down-regulate the activity of AP-1 by interfering with the functions of c-jun [ 36 , 37 ].
Therefore, the following set of experiments was designed to test if PPAR activation could reduce c-jun activation in 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treated microglia.
PPAR agonists including the prostaglandin, 15d-PGJ 2 , and two non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> and <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> , were tested in this series of experiments.
Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> together with these PPAR agonists for 12 hours, then processed for Western blot analyses.
Antibodies against c-jun, phospho-c-jun (at serine 63) and ERK 1/2 were used in this set of experiments.
Results indicated that while 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced the expression of c-jun and phospho-c-jun, these PPAR agonists reduced the expression to various degrees.
The apparent potency to reduce phospho-c-jun among the three agents tested was: 15d-PGJ 2 > <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> > <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> (Fig. 6 ).
These results indicated that while 15d-PGJ 2 was very effective in inhibiting c-jun activation, <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> appeared to be ineffective in this regard.
PPAR agonists reduced c-jun activation in 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treated microglia.
Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> together with 10 μM 15d-PGJ 2 , 100 μM <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> or 100 μM <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> for 12 hours, then processed for Western blot analyses.
Antibodies against c-jun, phospho-c-jun (at serine 63) and ERK 1/2 were used in this set of experiments.
Results indicated that these agents reduced 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced c-jun activation to various degrees.
PPAR agonists attenuate <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced cytotoxicity in microglia
Since PPAR agonists appeared to reduce the c-jun activation caused by 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treatment, the following experiment was designed to test if these agents could reduce 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cytotoxicity.
Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> together with PPAR agonists to be tested for 2 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
Results indicated that 15d-PGJ 2 could prevent 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner.
While treatment of the cells with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> reduced the cell viability to ~7% of controls, addition of 0.62, 1.25, 2.5, 5 or 10 μM 15d-PGJ 2 raised the viabilities to ~10, 14, 18, 34 or 48%, respectively (Fig. 7 ).
The rescue by 5 μM and 10 μM 15d-PGJ 2 was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
This agent at concentrations above 10 μM was toxic to microglia.
The solvent for 15d-PGJ 2 , methylacetate, was without any rescue effect.

Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> plus various concentrations of 15d-PGJ 2 for 2 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
* P< 0.001
 <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> also prevented 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 ).
This agent at 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μM raised the viability from ~8% to ~11, 13, 19 or 31% of controls, respectively.
A further increase in <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> to 200 μM did not increase cell viability.
The rescue by 50–200 μM <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> , on the other hand, had little rescue effect even at 200 μM (Fig. 9 ).
It is important to note that this agent also had no inhibitory effect on c-jun activation (Fig. 6 ).

Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> plus various concentrations of <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> for 2 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
While 15d-PGJ 2 is considered to be a PPARγ agonist, <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> and <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> can activate both PPARγ and PPARα [ 27 ].
The following experiment was conducted to determine if a pure PPARα agonist, WY14643, could modulate the 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cytotoxicity.
Results indicated that this agent was without rescue effect at 25, 50 or 100 μM.
At 200 μM, WY14643 raised the viability from ~10% to ~28% of controls.
The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).
No further increase in viability could be achieved by this agent (Fig. 10 ).

Cells were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> plus various concentrations of WY14643 for 2 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
* P < 0.001
Since 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced an alteration of phospho-ERK 1/2 during the first 6 hours of treatment (Fig. 5 ), an experiment was performed to test if inhibition of ERK pathways could affect 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cell death.
Microglia were treated with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> together with 10 μM AG126 (ERK inhibitor), PD98059 (MEK inhibitor, an up-stream member in the ERK pathway) for 2 days, then the viability of each treatment was determined.
Results indicated that neither of the pharmacological agents tested had any rescue effect toward 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cytotoxicity.
Similarly, the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, had no rescue effect under the same experimental conditions (results not shown).
Discussion
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are formed in <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> -containing food (powdered milk, cheese, egg products) during storage [ 38 , 39 ] or during <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> catabolism in animals [ 40 ].
The level of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide in meat product increases significantly during the cooking process [ 39 ].
Animals can take up <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides in a way similar to the absorption of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> .
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides given exogenously can be cleared from plasma rapidly and be widely redistributed in different parts of the body [ 41 ].
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides and authentic <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> are transported within the cell by a similar mechanism, but the transport is more efficient for <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides [ 42 ].
High levels of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides have been observed in hypercholesterolemic animals.
For example, the plasma level of 7-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> increases from 15 μM to approximately 200 μM in rabbits fed with high <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> diet for 6 weeks [ 43 ].
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide treatment can lead to alterations of cellular functions.
These compounds can activate some nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor 1 [ 44 ] and LXR, which may be partially responsible for their biological activities [ 45 , 46 ].
 <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> biosynthesis pathway [ 47 ].
The ability to bind to an intracellular receptor, oxysterol binding protein, may be responsible for their inhibition of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> biosynthesis [ 48 , 49 ].
It should be noted that addition of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> does not prevent <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced cell death, which leads to the suggestion that inhibition of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> synthesis is not the cause of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced PCD [ 50 , 51 ].
The critical events that result in <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced cytotoxicity remain to be determined.
Results from this study indicated that 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> was very cytotoxic to microglia, such that a 2-day treatment with 5 μM 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> reduced cell viability to 5–10% of controls.
In contrast, 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> was much less toxic to microglia (Fig. 1 , 2 ).
Selective toxicity of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides toward a particular cell type was also observed in our previous studies [ 29 , 31 - 33 ].
Further experiments with Western blot analyses indicated that the cytotoxicity of <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides was associated with their abilities to cause c-jun activation, as evidenced by the increase in activated c-jun, i.e., phospho-c-jun, in 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treated cells but not in 7-β-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> treated cells (Fig. 3 ).
There was a dose-dependent increase in c-jun activation in cells treated with 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> (Fig. 4 ).
It has been suggested that a dysregulation of MAP kinases is responsible for the growth factor deprivation [ 15 ] or chemotherapeutic agent [ 16 ] induced PCD.
Consistent with this idea, results from this study suggest that an unfavorable balance of the JNK and ERK causes the cell death observed in <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide treated microglia.
Cells treated with 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> showed a time-dependent increase in c-jun protein as well as phospho-c-jun (Fig. 5 ).
This c-jun activation was apparent at 6 hours after treatment.
In contrast, 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> caused a slight, initial increase in phospho-ERK, which decreased to a non-detectable level 6 hours after treatment.
The change in p38 and phospho-p38, on the other hand, was not as apparent.
It was reported that rabbits fed with high- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> diet exhibited high JNK protein levels and JNK activity in their atherosclerotic lesions, and oxidized LDL caused JNK activation in cultured smooth muscle cells [ 18 ].
Based on this study, there is a possibility that <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides in oxidized LDL were responsible for those previous observations.
Activation of the JNK pathway can lead to the phosphorylation of downstream members including c-jun that belongs to the AP-1 transcription factor family [ 12 , 52 ].
Because results from this study indicated that JNK pathway was activated by 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> , one could expect that AP-1 would be activated in cells treated with <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxides.
Consistent with this idea, it was shown that LDL could induce AP-1 activity in endothelial cells [ 53 ] and <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide treatment could lead to increased AP-1 DNA binding activity and AP-1 dependent transcription in other cell types [ 54 , 55 ].
Results from this study, thus, complemented and extended the findings of those reports.
The PPARγ agonist, 15d-PGJ 2 , functions as a general inhibitor of microglial functions [ 56 - 58 ].
For example, this agent inhibits the expression of inducible <START:DRUG> nitric Oxide <END> synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 β and major histocompatibility complex class II in activated microglia.
Inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) and the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) may be partially responsible for the inhibitory effects.
Results from this study further indicated that PPAR agonists could reduce c-jun activation (Fig. 6 ).
Given the suggestion that an up-regulation of c-jun is a cause of PCD [ 15 , 16 ], a reduction in c-jun activation by PPAR agonists should attenuate 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced cytotoxicity.
Consistent with this idea, results from this study indicated that 15d-PGJ 2 , <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> and WY14643 could attenuate the cytotoxicity caused by 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> to various degrees (Fig. 7 , 8 , 10 ).
Since the protective effect of WY14643 could be observed only at concentrations higher than 200 μM, there is a possibility that this agent acted on the PPARγ receptor to achieve the protection.
Similar protective roles of PPAR agonists have been shown in other nervous tissues.
For example, PPARγ agonists were shown to protect cytokine-induced PCD in cerebellar granule cells [ 59 ].
These agents could also block the neurotoxic effects caused by β-amyloid activated microglia, and thus might be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [ 60 ].
In non-neuronal tissues, PPARα activation was shown to suppress both spontaneous rat hepatocyte PCD and the PCD induced by transforming growth factor-β1 [ 61 ].
Conclusions
Treatment of microglia with 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> caused an induction of c-jun, phospho-c-jun and a reduction in cellular viability.
PPAR agonists reduced the 25-OH- <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> induced c-jun activation and attenuated the cytotoxicity.
This group of compounds may be useful in future development of pharmacological agents against <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> oxide induced cytotoxicity.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The N9 murine microglia cell line was a gift kindly provided by Dr. P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli [ 62 ].
This cell line has been used extensively as a model for microglia [ 63 - 65 ].
These cells were derived by immortalization of day 13 embryonic brain cultures with a retrovirus carrying an activated v-myc oncogene.
The cultures were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1.4 mM glutamine (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY) and 20 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
WY14643 and 15d-PGJ 2 were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI).
 <START:DRUG> indomethacin <END> , <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> and all other pharmacological and general biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.
Cell viability
Cells grown in 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well, ~90% confluency) were treated with testing agents for a period of time as indicated in the figure legends; then, the viability from each treatment was determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay [ 66 ].
Culture medium was removed after treatment, then 100 μl MTT solution (100 μg/ml prepared in MEM) was added to each well.
The cultures were incubated at 37°C for one hour in a tissue culture incubator.
The MTT solution was then removed, and the cells in each well were lysed by the addition of 100 μl dimethly sulfoxide.
The plate was placed on a shaker for one hour at room temperature to complete the lysing process, then the optical density of each well was measured by a 96-well plate reader with a filter setting at 570 nm (reference filter setting was 630 nm).
Western blot analysis
Protein isolated from cytoplasm was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (NitroBind, MSI, Westborough, MA), then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C.
Specific bands were detected by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 45 minutes at room temperature, then with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The primary antibodies used in this set of experiments were from New England Biological (anti-phospho-c-jun at serine 73, used at 1:1000) or Santa Cruz (anti-c-jun, used at 1:3000; anti-phospho-c-jun at serine 63, used at 1:1000, anti-JNK, used at 1:3000; anti-ERK 1/2, used at 1:3000; anti-phospho-ERK, used at 1:2000; anti-p38, used at 1:3000; anti-phospho-p38, used at 1:1000).
Statistical analysis

Pharmacokinetic interactions between <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in healthy volunteers following concurrent administration.
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions between <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in healthy volunteers.
Ten healthy volunteers were each given 600-mg single oral doses of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> alone, <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> alone (200 mg every 12 h for 9 days), and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in combination with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , in a three-period pharmacokinetic nonrandomized sequential design study.
 <START:DRUG> quinine <END> was co-administered with the 15th dose of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Blood samples collected at predetermined time intervals were analysed for <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method.
Downward dosage adjustment of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> appears necessary when concurrently administered with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Concurrent <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> administration resulted in about fourfold increases in both the C(max) and AUC(T) [C(max) 2.79 +/- 0.22 vs. 10.72 +/- 0.32 mg l(-1), 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.81, 8.04; AUC 50.06 +/- 2.52 vs. 220.47 +/- 6.68 mg h(-1) l(-1), 95% CI 166.3, 175.3], a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the elimination half-life (11.15 +/- 0.80 vs. 13.37 +/- 0.33 h, 95% CI 1.64, 2.77) and about a 4.5-fold decrease in CL/F (12.01 +/- 0.61 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.09 l h(-1)) of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
Also, with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , there was a pronounced reduction of AUC(metabolite)/AUC(unchanged drug) ratio of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> (1.35 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02) along with a marked decrease in C(max) (1.80 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.09 mg l(-1)) and AUC(0-48h) (62.80 +/- 6.30 vs. 25.61 +/- 2.44 mg h(-1) l(-1)) of the metabolite.
Similarly, <START:DRUG> quinine <END> caused modest but significant increases (P < 0.01) in the C(max), AUC and elimination T((1/2)) of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Phase I study of <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> (PSC-833) with <START:DRUG> mitoxantrone <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> in refractory and relapsed pediatric acute leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.
 <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> , a non-immunosuppressive analog of cylosporine, is a potent P-glycoprotein (MDR1) inhibitor.
As MDR1-mediated efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from leukemic blasts may contribute to drug resistance, a phase 1 study of <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> combined with <START:DRUG> mitoxantrone <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias was performed.
Patients received a <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> -loading dose (2 mg/kg) followed by a 5-day continuous <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> infusion (8, 10, 12.5, or 15 mg/kg/day) combined with lower than standard doses of <START:DRUG> mitoxantrone <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> .
The <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> dose was escalated using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design.
Twenty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity and 20 for response.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> was 12.5 mg/kg/day, combined with 50% dose-reduced <START:DRUG> mitoxantrone <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> .
Dose-limiting toxicities included stomatitis, ataxia, and bone marrow aplasia.
Three of 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had complete responses while no patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had an objective response.
In vitro studies demonstrated P-glycoprotein expression on the blasts of 5 of 14 patients, although only 1 had inhibition of rhodamine efflux by <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> .
While this regimen was tolerable, responses in this heavily pretreated population were limited to a subset of patients with ALL.
The clearance of <START:DRUG> mitoxantrone <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> was decreased by 64% and 60%, respectively, when combined with <START:DRUG> valspodar <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly affect the pharmacokinetics, but not the safety or QTc interval, of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> , a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist.
 <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> , an antiemetic, is a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Three phase 1 studies with 131 healthy subjects examined the impact of a strong CYP3A inhibitor ( <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) and inducer ( <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> .
Oral <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> was administered alone (study 1, 100-mg single dose; study 2, 150 mg on day 1, 50 mg on days 2 and 3; study 3, 150-mg single dose) with either 400 mg daily of oral <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or 600 mg daily of oral <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Neither safety signals nor prolongation of Fredericia-corrected QT was observed at these increased exposures in study 2.
These clinical studies confirmed the role of CYP3A in the metabolism and disposition of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> .
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> with strong inhibitors of CYP3A is likely to increase plasma exposure of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> , whereas coadministration with strong inducers of CYP3A is likely to decrease <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> exposure and compromise efficacy.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased the maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration time curve to the last sampling time, t (AUC(0-t)) of single-dose <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> 2.7-fold and 12-fold and increased the C(max) of 3-day <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> 2.5-fold on day 1 and 2.9-fold on day 3, whereas AUC((0-tau)) increased 4.3-fold on day 1 and 5.8-fold on day 3.
Repeat-dose <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the C(max) and AUC((0-t)) of <START:DRUG> casopitant <END> 96% and 90%, respectively.
A phase I dose escalation and pharmacokinetic study of vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584) in combination with <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> in patients with advanced solid tumors.
To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for weekly <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> administered in combination with daily vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584, PTK/ZK) and assess for a drug-drug interaction.
Patients were treated with escalating doses of weekly <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> (75-85 mg/m(2)), and daily TK/ZK (250-1,000 mg).
During the first cycle only, <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> was given on days 1 and 15, and PTK/ZK on days 3-28.
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on cycle 1 days 1 and 15 for <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> , and on cycle 1 day 15 for PTK/ZK.
Therapy was given until disease progression.
Twenty-seven patients were accrued to four dose levels.
Two of five patients treated with <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 85 mg/m(2) and PTK/ZK 1,000 mg had Grade 3 transaminase elevation as dose-limiting toxicity.
Activity included one partial response and 11 patients with stable disease > or =4 months, including patients previously treated with <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> .
The MTD for weekly <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> plus daily PTK/ZK is 75 mg/m(2) and 750 mg.
This combination was well tolerated with evidence of anti-cancer activity and provides guidance for phase 2 planning.
Paired PK analyses demonstrated a significant increase in <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> clearance on day 15 (p = 0.006).
PK analysis revealed a significant drug-drug interaction, with an increase in <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> clearance.
Effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously and orally administered <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP34A) inhibitor <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally and intravenously administered <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Twelve healthy subjects were administered 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally for 5 days in a four-session paired cross-over study.
On day 4, <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> was administered intravenously (0.1 mg/kg) in the first part of the study and orally (10 mg) in the second part.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 h, and pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the exposure to <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> by inhibiting its CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation.
The clinical use of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> in patients receiving multiple doses of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> for pain relief may increase the risk of opioid-associated adverse effects.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreased plasma clearance (Cl) and increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-infinity) of intravenous <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> by 32 and 51%, respectively (P<0.001) and increased the AUC(0-infinity) of orally administrated <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> by 144% (P<0.001).
Most of the pharmacokinetic changes in oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were seen in the elimination phase, with modest effects by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on its peak concentration, which was increased by 45% (P=0.009).
The AUC(0-48) of noroxycodone was decreased by 49% (P<0.001) and that of <START:DRUG> oxymorphone <END> was increased by 359% (P<0.001) after the administration of oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
The pharmacologic effects of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were enhanced by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> only modestly.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between oral <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> in healthy subjects: role of P-glycoprotein inhibition by <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme.
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4.
It is therefore likely that <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> can alter the absorption and metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared in 14 healthy male Korean volunteers (age range 22-28 years) who had been administered <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> (60 mg) orally in the presence or absence of oral <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> (20 mg).
The design of the experiment was a standard 2 x 2 crossover model in random order.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> were significantly altered by the co-administration of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> compared to the control.
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) and the peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> were significantly increased by 62.8 and 32.1%, respectively.
Consequently, the relative bioavailability of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> was also significantly increased (by 76.5%).
The (AUC (0-infinity)) of norverapamil and the terminal half-life of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> did not significantly changed with <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> coadministration.
The metabolite-parent ratio was significantly reduced (29.2%) in the presence of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> increased the absorption of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> by inhibiting P-gp and inhibited the first-pass metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> by inhibiting CYP3A4 in the intestine and/or liver in humans.
Inhibition of oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> clearance by boosting doses of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , and by 4,4-dimethyl-benziso-(2H)-selenazine ( <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> ), an experimental catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: * The viral protease inhibitor <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> is known to inhibit clearance of intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
* <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> , a catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase, inhibits human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms in vitro.
* Short-term administration of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increases area under the plasma concentration curve following oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> by a factor of 28.
* Therefore <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> is an appropriate positive control inhibitor for clinical drug interaction studies involving CYP3A substrates.
* <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> clearance is weakly inhibited by <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> , consistent with its in vitro profile.
We evaluated whether 'boosting' doses of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> can serve as a positive control inhibitor for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies involving cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).
The study also determined whether 4,4-dimethyl-benziso-(2H)-selenazine ( <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> ), an investigational organoselenium compound that acts as a catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase, inhibits CYP3A metabolism in vivo.
Thirteen healthy volunteers received single 3-mg oral doses of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> on three occasions: in the control condition, during co-treatment with low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (three oral doses of 100 mg over 24 h), and during co-treatment with <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> (three oral doses of 80 mg over 24 h).
Low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> produces extensive CYP3A inhibition exceeding that of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (typically 10- to 15-fold <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> AUC enhancement), and is a suitable positive control index inhibitor for drug-drug interaction studies.
 <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> inhibits CYP3A metabolism to a small degree that is of uncertain clinical importance.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increased mean (+/-SE) total area under the curve (AUC) for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> by a factor of 28.4 +/- 4.2 (P < 0.001), and reduced oral clearance to 4.2 +/- 0.5% of control (P < 0.001).
In contrast, <START:DRUG> aLT-2074 <END> increased <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> AUC by 1.25 +/- 0.11 (P < 0.05), and reduced oral clearance to 88 +/- 8% of control.
Investigation of the pharmacokinetic interactions of <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> , a once-daily oral iron chelator, with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> , a newly developed iron chelator, was coadministered orally with either a known inducer of drug metabolism or with cosubstrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) to characterize the potential for drug-drug interactions.
In the induction assessment, single-dose <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> pharmacokinetics were obtained in the presence and absence of a repeated-dose regimen of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
In the CYP3A interaction evaluation, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and its active hydroxylated metabolite were assessed after single doses of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in the presence and absence of steady-state concentrations of <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> .
To test for interaction at the level of CPY2C8, single-dose <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were determined with and without repeated-dose administration of <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> .
Specific patient prescribing recommendations were established when coadministering <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> , and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
These recommendations may also apply to other substrates of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8 or potent inducers of glucuronidation.
After <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , a significant reduction (44%) in plasma exposure (AUC) to <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> was observed.
Upon coadministration of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , there was a modest reduction of up to 22% in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> exposure (AUC, C(max)), suggesting a modest induction of CYP3A4/5 by <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> .
 <START:DRUG> deferasirox <END> caused increases in <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> plasma C(max) and AUC of 1.5-fold to over 2-fold, respectively, with little change in blood glucose measures.
Inhibition of the active principle of the weak opioid <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> by the triazole antifungal <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
To investigate in vivo the influence of the potent CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects of <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> .
Sixteen healthy volunteers received <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (400 mg) or placebo together with a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> (100 mg).
Blood samples and urine were collected for 24 h and experimental pain was determined by using the cold pressor test.
Noncompartimental analysis was performed to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> , nortilidine and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , whereas pharmacodynamic parameters were analysed by nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman).
After <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> much lower serum concentrations of bisnortilidine were observed.
Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events was almost doubled after <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> caused a 20-fold increase in exposition of <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> in serum [AUC 1250.8 h*ng ml(-1), 95% confidence interval (CI) 1076.8, 1424.9 vs. 61 h*ng ml(-1), 95% CI 42.6, 80.9; P < 0.0001], whereas the AUC of nortilidine also increased 2.5-fold.
The onset of analgesic activity occurred later with <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , which is in agreement with the prolonged t(max) of nortilidine (0.78 h, 95% CI 0.63, 0.93 vs. 2.5 h, 95% CI 1.85, 3.18; P < 0.0001) due to the additional inhibition of nortilidine metabolism to bisnortilidine.
After <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> the AUC under the pain withdrawal-time curve was reduced compared with placebo (149 s h(-1), 95% CI 112, 185 vs. 175 s h(-1), 95% CI 138, 213; P < 0.016), mainly due to the shorter withdrawal time 0.75 h after <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> administration.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> significantly inhibited the sequential metabolism of <START:DRUG> tilidine <END> with increased exposure of the active nortilidine.
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, greatly increases exposure to oral S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> .
Oral <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> is used as an adjuvant in the treatment of refractory neuropathic and cancer-related pain.
Drug interactions may alter the analgesic or other effects of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> .
The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme inhibition with <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> in a randomized controlled cross-over study with two phases.
Ten healthy subjects were pre-treated with oral <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> or placebo for 4 days.
On day 4, they ingested an oral dose of 0.2mg/kg of S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> syrup.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> and norketamine were measured for 24h.
Analgesic effects were evaluated in a cold pressor test and psychomotor effects were followed for 12h.
This increase is reflected as modest changes in behavioral effects of oral S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> increased the mean C(max) of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> by 3.6-fold (p<0.001) and the mean AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> by 2.6-fold (p=0.001).
The relative amount of the CYP3A dependent metabolite norketamine was decreased by 54% by <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> (p=0.004).
Self-rated drug effect of S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> was enhanced by <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> (p<0.05) but other behavioral effects or cold pain scores were not affected.
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> strongly increases plasma concentrations of oral S- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> probably by inhibiting its CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation.
Time-dependent inhibitory effects of (1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,18E,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-1,14-dihydroxy-12-(E)-2- [(1R,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]-1-methylvinyl-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-17-(2-oxopropyl)-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo [22.3.1.0(4.9)]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetrone ( <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> ), a novel nonimmunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, on CYP3A4/5 activity in humans in vivo and in vitro.
We investigated the inhibitory effects of (1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,18E,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-1, 14-dihydroxy-12-(E)-2- [(1R,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]-1-methylvinyl-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-17-(2-oxopropyl)-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo [22.3.1.0(4.9)]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetrone ( <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> ), a novel nonimmunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, on CYP3A4/5 in in vitro and in vivo settings.
First, the inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> (preincubation dependence, inactivation rate estimation, and reversibility) were tested using human liver microsomes.
Second, the effect of repeated oral doses of <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> (60 mg q.d.
for 14 days) on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (single oral 2-mg dose) was tested in healthy volunteers.
Finally, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were performed.
In vitro experiments showed that <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> inhibited CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent and irreversible manner.
The in vitro maximum inactivation rate constant (k(inact)) and concentration of inhibitor that gave half-maximal k(inact) (K(I)) were estimated to be 10.1 h(-1) and 2050 ng/ml, respectively.
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> weakly or moderatelyinhibited the activity of CYP3A4/5 in vitro and vivo at the tested dose.
The model developed here would be helpful in predicting drug-drug interactions and in the design of dose regimens that avoid drug-drug interactions.
In the clinical study, <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> produced a 2-fold increase in the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
A pharmacokinetic model developed for this study, which described the time course of concentrations of both <START:DRUG> fK1706 <END> and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and incorporated CYP3A4/5 inactivation in the liver and intestine, successfully predicted the change in the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> using in vitro k(inact) and K(I) values (1.66- to 2.81-fold increases in AUC predicted) and estimated the in vivo inactivation rate to be 0.00404 to 0.0318 h(-1) x ml/ng.
Effects of the P-glycoprotein inducer <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> on <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> pharmacokinetics.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> , a P-glycoprotein inducer, on <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> pharmacokinetics.
Twelve healthy Japanese volunteers (nine males and three females) were enrolled in this study after giving written informed consent.
This randomized open-label study consisted of two phases (control and 7-day treatment) with a 2-week washout period.
In the control phase, volunteers received 60 mg <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> hydrochloride after an overnight fast.
In the treatment phase, <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> was dosed 100 mg three times daily (for a total daily dose of 300 mg) for 7 days, and on Day 7, a single 60-mg dose of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> was coadministered with a 100-mg dose of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> .
The plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> were measured for 24 hours after dosing.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> pretreatment significantly altered <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> pharmacokinetics, decreasing the mean (+/- standard deviation) peak plasma concentration from 176.6 (+/- 82.1) ng/mL to 103.2 (+/- 33.6) ng/mL (P < 0.01) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 1058.4 (+/- 528.7) ng/h/mL to 604.8 (+/- 255.9) ng/h/mL (P < 0.01) without changing the elimination half-life.
Relatively, <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> significantly reduced the amount of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> excreted into the urine from 8.1 (+/- 2.1) mg to 4.5 (+/- 1.4) mg (P < 0.001), although the renal clearance of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> remained constant between the two study phases.
Thus, this study indicates that <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> significantly decreases <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> plasma concentrations, probably as a result of P-glycoprotein induction in the small intestine.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> treatment, therefore, is of moderate clinical significance for patients receiving <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> - <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on cytochrome P450 3A4 activity in healthy volunteers using <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> as a probe.
To investigate the inhibitory potential of multiple doses of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> on the pharmacokinetics of oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 model substrate.
Prospective, open-label, one-sequence, two-period crossover study.
Clinical pharmacology unit in the United Kingdom.
Eighteen healthy adult male and female volunteers (median age 37.5 yrs).
Intervention.
A single oral dose of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 7.5 mg was administered on day 1.
A second dose was administered on day 16, after 14 days of oral <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> 1000 mg- <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 100 mg twice/day.
Serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and its metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were determined when <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was given alone (day 1) and after coadministration with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> - <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> for 14 days (day 16).
Two weeks of treatment with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> - <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> resulted in a 4.3-fold increase in maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and a 12.4-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 's half-life increased from 4.7 to 14.9 hours.
Concomitant reductions for 1'-hydroxymidazolam were approximately 7-fold for C(max) and 2-fold for AUC(0-infinity).
The 1'-hydroxymidazolam AUC(0-infinity): <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> AUC(0-infinity) ratio was only 1% during coadministration of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> - <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> compared with 33% for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> alone.
Adverse-event reports indicated that the combination of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was well tolerated but resulted in prolonged sedation.
Administration of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> markedly increased the exposure of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> by inhibiting its metabolism, confirming that the combination of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> at steady state strongly inhibits CYP3A4 activity.
Effects of <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> , a CYP1A2 inhibitor, on <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The aim of this study was to determine whether <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> , a CYP1A2 inhibitor, altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> were examined in an open-label study in 12 healthy participants after a single dose of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> (2 mg) with and without <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> coadministration (50 mg, 3 times as a pretreatment for a day and 2 times on the study day).
Of the 15 patients treated with <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> , 4 suffered <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> -induced adverse effects such as drowsiness and dry mouth in the retrospective survey.
Compared with <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> alone, <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> coadministration increased the peak plasma concentration (1.8 +/- 0.8 vs 5.3 +/- 1.8 ng/mL), area under the curve (4.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.4 +/- 6.5 ng x h/mL), and the half-life (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 1.8 +/- 0.7 h) of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> , respectively (P < .05).
reduction in systolic blood pressure (-10 +/- 8 vs -24 +/- 7 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (-10 +/- 7 vs -18 +/- 8 mm Hg) after <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> administration was also significantly enhanced by coadministration of <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> (P < .01).
Present results suggested that coadministration of <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> increased blood <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> concentrations and enhanced <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> pharmacodynamics in terms of reduction in blood pressure and adverse symptoms.
Effect of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
The aim of this study is to determine whether the inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activity with <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> in a randomized 2-phase crossover study.
Eleven healthy subjects were pretreated with 800 mg of oral <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> or placebo for 4 days.
On day 3, they ingested 10 mg of immediate-release <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 hours, and pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated.
reduction of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> dose by 25% to 50% followed by readjustment according to the clinical response might be appropriate.
 <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> by 80% (P < .001) and reduced the AUC(0-infinity) of noroxycodone by 46% (P < .001).
Most of the pharmacokinetic changes were seen in the elimination phase, with little effect by <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> on the peak concentration of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were modestly enhanced by <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> .
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> clearly reduces the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> to noroxycodone by inhibiting the CYP450 3A4 enzyme.
The use of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> in patients receiving multiple doses of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> for pain relief may increase the risk of opioid adverse effects.
Pharmacokinetics of concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> and <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> without <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> in human immunodeficiency virus-negative subjects.
To quantify the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> and <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> (administered as the prodrug <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> ) alone and in combination in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative subjects.
Randomized, open-label, three-way crossover study.
Research facility.
Eleven men and 10 women who were seronegative for HIV.
Subjects were randomized to 14-day treatment periods of <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> 1400 mg once/day, <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> 400 mg once/day, or <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> 1400 mg plus <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> 400 mg once/day; after a washout period of at least 21 days between each treatment, they received the other two treatments.
Subjects underwent 24-hour pharmacokinetic sampling at baseline and on day 14 of each treatment period.
Primary outcome measures were area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C(max)) for <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> and <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> .
When <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> was given alone, the geometric mean of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> 's AUC was 20.2 microg x hour/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-21.2 microg x hr/ml).
Adverse events were assessed at each study visit and 1 month after the subjects completed the three treatments.
Both drugs were well tolerated.
One serious adverse event (grade 3 acute pancreatitis) occurred and resolved without further incident.
This dosing scheme is not a recommended combination of dual, fully active protease inhibitors.
 <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> significantly enhanced the exposure of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> .
When given in combination with <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> , <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> had an AUC of 39.8 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 38.7-40.9 microg x hr/ml).
Similarly, the C(max) for <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> increased from 4193 ng/ml (95% CI 3927-4459 ng/ml) to 6621 ng/ml (95% CI 6427-6814 ng/ml) when given in combination with <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> .
In contrast, AUC and C(max) for <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> significantly decreased when <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> was coadministered with <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> ; AUC decreased from 17.6 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 16.6-18.7 microg x hr/ml) to 11.8 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 11.3-12.3 microg x hr/ml), and C(max) decreased from 2507 ng/ml (95% CI 2379-2635 ng/ml) to 1832 ng/ml (95% CI 1752-1911 ng/ml).
 <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> 400 mg/day plus <START:DRUG> fosamprenavir <END> 1400 mg/day significantly decreased concentrations of <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> compared with standard dosing regimens of each drug alone.
Effects of oral <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> alone and with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> or with <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> in healthy adult volunteers.
Patients with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk for opportunistic fungal infections.
These patients may require concomitant treatment with antiretrovirals and azole antifungals, and interactions between these classes of drugs should be anticipated.
A phase 1, open-label, randomized, crossover, drug interaction study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic effects of coadministration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> (400 mg twice daily), with <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> (ATV) (300 mg/d alone) and with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (100 mg/d) or with <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (400 mg/d) in healthy volunteers.
Most subjects who received ATV (with and without <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> ) and <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> experienced clinically relevant increases in total bilirubin.
Frequent monitoring of adverse events and toxicity related to antiviral exposure is recommended in the event of coadministration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> and ATV with or without <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
In addition, because of decreased <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> exposure, coadministration with <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> should be avoided unless the benefit to patients outweighs the risk.
 <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> increased maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ATV by 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> increased ATV Cmax and AUC when administered with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> by 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> resulted in clinically relevant decreases of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> Cmax and AUC of approximately45% and 50%, respectively.
Enantioselective disposition of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> with the P-glycoprotein inhibitor <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
The aim was to compare possible effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , as a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of each <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> enantiomer, as a P-gp substrate.
Thirteen healthy Japanese volunteers (10 male and three female) were enrolled.
In a randomized, two-phase, crossover design, <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> was dosed 80 mg three times daily (with total daily doses of 240 mg) for 6 days, and on day 6, a single 120-mg dose of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> was administered along with an 80-mg dose of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
Subsequently, <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> was administered alone after a 2-week wash-out period.
The plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> enantiomers were measured up to 24 h after dosing.
During the control phase, the mean AUC(0-infinity) of S(-)- and R(+)- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> was 700 ng h(-1) ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI) 577, 823] and 1202 ng h(-1) ml(-1) (95% CI 1007, 1396), respectively, with a significant difference (P < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> had a greater effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of S(-)- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> compared with those of the R(+)-enantiomer, and increased AUC(0-infinity) of S(-)- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> and R(+)- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> by 3.5-fold (95% CI of differences 1.9, 5.1; P < 0.001) and by 2.2-fold (95% CI of differences 1.7, 3.0; P < 0.001), respectively.
The R/S ratio for the AUC(0-infinity) was reduced from 1.76 to 1.32 (P < 0.001) by <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> treatments.
This study indicates that P-gp plays a key role in the stereoselectivity of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> pharmacokinetics, since the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> enantiomers were altered by the P-gp inhibitor <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and this effect was greater for S- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> compared with R- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> .
Influence of <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> coadministration on <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients: a population approach.
The influence of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> coadministration on <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> pharmacokinetics was investigated in HIV-infected patients using a population-based approach.
The population was composed of 51 patients (89 samples; 42 patients treated with an antiretroviral regimen containing <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nine patients treated with a regimen containing a combination of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> and <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> ).
A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was fitted to the data using nonmem version V (GloboMax, Ellicott City, MD, USA).
Relationships were established between <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> clearance (Cl) and age (CL/F=2.42+47.2/age, where F denotes bioavailability) and between <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> volume of distribution (V(d)) and the presence of <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> in the antiretroviral regimen [V(d)/F=38.0+75.0 (1 - <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> coadministration), where <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> coadministration is 1 for patients treated with a combination of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> and <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> and 0 for other patients].
According to this final model, a significant decrease in the means of CL/F (3.84 +/- 0.92 vs. 2.76 +/- 1.00 L/h; P<0.05) and V(d)/F (93.2 +/- 31.10 vs. 39.8 +/- 6.97 L; P<0.0001) and an increase in the mean of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> trough plasma concentrations (3.68 +/- 1.69 vs. 5.35 +/- 3.20 mg/L; P<0.05) are observed if <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> is used in combination with <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> .
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> exposure is increased when <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> is administered in combination with <START:DRUG> darunavir <END> and that therapeutic drug monitoring of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> should be performed if this antiretroviral regimen is considered.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> greatly reduces the plasma concentrations of intravenous and oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A and 2D6 enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> is a strong inducer of several drug-metabolizing enzymes.
The authors studied the interaction of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> with <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Their hypothesis was that <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> enhances the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> and attenuates its pharmacologic effect.
The protocol was a four-session, paired crossover.
Twelve volunteers were given 600 mg oral <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or placebo once daily for 7 days.
 <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> was given on day 6.
In the first part of the study, 0.1 mg/kg <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> hydrochloride was given intravenously.
In the second part of the study, 15 mg <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> hydrochloride was given orally.
Concentrations of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> and its metabolites noroxycodone, <START:DRUG> oxymorphone <END> , and noroxymorphone were determined for 48 h.
Psychomotor effects were characterized for 12 h by several visual analog scales.
Analgesic effects were characterized by measuring the heat pain threshold and cold pain sensitivity.
To maintain adequate analgesia, dose adjustment of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> may be necessary, when used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> decreased the area under the <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> by 53% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.001).
Oral bioavailability of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> was decreased from 69% to 21% (P < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> greatly increased the plasma metabolite-to-parent drug ratios for noroxycodone and noroxymorphone (P < 0.001).
Pharmacologic effects of oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were attenuated.
Induction of cytochrome P450 3A by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the area under the <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
The pharmacologic effects of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were modestly attenuated.
Effects of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> on <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
To characterize the impact of potent CYP3A4 inhibition and induction on <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> pharmacokinetics.
Two studies were conducted in healthy subjects.
One study examined the effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 200 mg b.i.d.
for 7 days on a single 100-mg dose of <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> in 22 healthy subjects.
The other study examined the effect of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> titrated up to 200 mg b.i.d.
over 20 days on a single 250-mg dose of <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> in 24 healthy subjects.
Dose adjustments may be required when <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> is administered with orally administered drugs that potently alter the activity of this enzyme.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> altered <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> AUC, C(max) and half-life, with geometric mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] increases of 3.57-fold (3.07, 4.15), 2.14-fold (1.74, 2.64) and 1.66-fold (1.50, 1.84), respectively, but had no effect on absorption rate.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> altered <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> AUC, C(max) and absorption rate, with geometric mean (95% CI) decreases of 72% (68, 77), 59% (49, 66) and 28% (4, 46), respectively, but had no effect on half-life.
Systemic exposure to <START:DRUG> lapatinib <END> was significantly altered by potent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4.
Effects of oral <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetic properties of oral and intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> : a phase I, randomized, open-label, crossover study in healthy volunteers.
Like <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> , a broad-spectrum oral triazole antifungal, inhibits the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme 3A4.
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , a short-acting benzodiazepine, is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Potential drug interactions can be expected in patients who are concurrently receiving inhibitors and substrates of CYP3A4 (eg, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> ) and benzodiazepines (eg, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ).
Because of the potential for drug interactions, it is important to determine the effects of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetic properties of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of oral administration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> versus <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetic properties of orally and intravenously administered <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
This Phase I, randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted at Swiss Pharma Contract Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland.
Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
Arm 1 received <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> 200 mg BID for 7 days, <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> 400 mg BID for 7 days, no drugs during a 28-day washout, and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 400 mg once daily for 7 days.
Arm 2 received <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> in the reverse order, with a 28-day washout between treatments.
An oral/IV <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> sequence (oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 2 mg and IV <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 0.4 mg) was administered on days -2/-1, 6/7, 13/14 (arm 1), 36/17 (arm 2), 43/44, and 50/51 in both treatment arms.
Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> administration.
Pharmacokinetic parameters, including C(max), C(min) (before azole administration), terminal-phase t(1/2) (t(1/2z)), and AUC to final measurable sampling time (AUC(tf)), were calculated using noncompartmental methods, and drug interactions were evaluated using analysis of variance.
Adverse events were collected using physical examination, including vital sign measurements; clinical laboratory analysis; electrocardiography; and direct questioning at predefined time points throughout the study to assess tolerability.
A total of 12 subjects were enrolled (11 men, 1 woman; all white; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 28-53 years]; mean weight, 80.6 kg; and mean body mass index, 25.6 kg/m(2)).
All of the subjects completed the study.
Seven of 12 (58%) subjects reported > or =1 adverse event during the study (5 with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> alone and 4 with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> + <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ).
The most common adverse events were diarrhea (3 subjects [25%] with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> alone, 2 [17%] with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> alone, and 1 [8%] with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> + <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ) and flatulence (1 [8%] with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> alone and 1 [8%] with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> alone).
The results from this study in a small, all-white population of healthy volunteers suggest that <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> was a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, but to a lesser extent than was <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Monitoring patients for adverse events, the need for dose adjustments, or both during coadministration with <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> may be warranted in patients being treated with benzodiazepines that are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4 (eg, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ).
Based on point estimates of logarithm-transformed data, <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> 200 and 400 mg BID were associated with significant increases in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> C(max) (up to 1.3- and 2.4-fold) and AUC(tf) values (up to 4.6- and 6.2-fold), respectively.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 400 mg once daily was associated with significantly increased <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> C(max) and AUC(tf) (up to 2.8- and 8.2-fold, respectively).
When <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was concurrently administered with either azole, t(1/2z) was prolonged.
Effects of concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> on the disposition of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> are likely to be administered concurrently in the treatment of patients with HIV and malaria.
Both drugs are metabolised to a significant extent by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> is also an inducer of this enzyme.
This study therefore evaluated the effect of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> quinine <END> (600 mg single dose) was administered either alone or with the 17th dose of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> (200 mg every 12 h for 12 days) to 14 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion.
Blood samples collected at predetermined time intervals were analysed for <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxquinine, using a validated HPLC method.
Administration of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> plus <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> resulted in significant decreases (P < 0.01) in the total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(T)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and terminal elimination half-life (T((1/2)beta)) of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> compared with values with <START:DRUG> quinine <END> dosing alone (AUC: 53.29 +/- 4.01 vs 35.48 +/- 2.01 h mg/l; C(max): 2.83 +/- 0.16 vs 1.81 +/- 0.06 mg/l; T((1/2)beta): 11.35 +/- 0.72 vs 8.54 +/- 0.76 h), while the oral plasma clearance markedly increased (11.32 +/- 0.84 vs 16.97 +/- 0.98 l/h).
In the presence of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> there was a pronounced increase in the ratio of AUC(metabolite)/AUC (unchanged drug) and highly significant increases in C(max) and AUC of the metabolite (P < 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
An increase in the dose of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> may be necessary when the drug is co-administered with <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> .
Mechanism of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> changes in <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: II.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> effects on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein activities.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> diminishes <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentrations, an effect attributed to CYP3A induction, but the actual mechanisms are unknown.
We determined short-term (2-day) and steady-state (2-week) <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> effects on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4/5 (probed with intravenous (IV) and oral <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> (ALF) and with miosis) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) ( <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> ), and on <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers.
Acute <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> inhibits first-pass CYP3A > 96%.
Chronic <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> inhibits hepatic CYP3A (> 70%) and first-pass CYP3A (> 90%).
Steady-state compared with acute <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> caused mild apparent induction of P-gp and hepatic CYP3A, but net inhibition still predominated.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> inhibited both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A and drug transport.
ALF miosis noninvasively determined CYP3A inhibition by <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Acute <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-infinity)/dose ratio ( <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> /control) for oral ALF 25-fold.
Steady-state <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increased the AUC(0-Infinity)/dose ratio for IV and oral ALF 4- and 10-fold, respectively; reduced hepatic extraction (from 0.26 to 0.07) and intestinal extraction (from 0.51 to 0); and increased bioavailability (from 37 to 95%).
Acute and steady-state <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increased the <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> AUC(0-infinity) 2.8- and 1.4-fold, respectively, suggesting P-gp inhibition.
Mechanism of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> changes in <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: I. Evidence against CYP3A mediation of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> diminishes <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentrations, an effect attributed to CYP3A induction, but the actual mechanisms are unknown.
We determined <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> effects on stereoselective <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and clinical effects (pupillary miosis) in healthy human immunodeficiency virus-negative volunteers.
Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic <START:DRUG> methadone <END> after no <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , short-term (3-day) <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , and steady-state <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Bioavailability was unchanged despite significant inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein.
Intestinal and hepatic CYP3A was inhibited > 70%.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> shifted <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentration-miosis curves leftward and upward.
Rapid <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> induction of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance results from increased renal clearance and induced hepatic metabolism.
Induction of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism occurred despite profound CYP3A inhibition, suggesting no role for CYP3A in clinical <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism and clearance.
Acute and steady-state <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , respectively, caused 1.5- and 2-fold induction of systemic and apparent oral R- and S- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearances.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> increased renal clearance 40-50%, and stereoselectively (S > R) increased hepatic <START:DRUG> methadone <END> N-demethylation 50-80%, extraction twofold, and clearance twofold.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> may alter <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacodynamics.
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism and clearance are induced by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> despite inhibition of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity.
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentrations are decreased by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance and the drug interactions have been attributed to CYP3A4, but actual mechanisms of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance and the <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> interaction are unknown.
We assessed <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> effects on <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4/5 activity, and intestinal P-glycoprotein transport activity.
CYP3A4/5 and transporters were assessed using <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> and <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> , respectively.
Twelve healthy HIV-negative volunteers underwent a sequential crossover.
On three consecutive days they received oral <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> plus <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> , intravenous <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> , and intravenous plus oral <START:DRUG> methadone <END> .
This was repeated after <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> .
Plasma and urine analytes were measured by mass spectrometry.
Opioid effects were measured by pupil diameter change (miosis).
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> bioavailability and P-glycoprotein activity were minimally affected.
Induction occurred despite 50% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4/5 activity and more than 75% inhibition of first-pass CYP3A4/5 activity, suggesting little or no role for CYP3A in clinical <START:DRUG> methadone <END> disposition.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> decreased intravenous and oral <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentrations 40-50%.
Systemic clearance, hepatic clearance, and hepatic extraction all increased 1.6- and 2-fold, respectively, for R- and S- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> ; apparent oral clearance increased 1.7- and 1.9-fold.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> stereoselectively increased (S>R) <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism and metabolite formation clearance, and <START:DRUG> methadone <END> renal clearance.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> decreased <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> systemic and apparent oral clearances 50 and 76%, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> appeared to shift the <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentration-effect (miosis) curve leftward and upward.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> induced <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance by increasing renal clearance, and more so by stereoselectively increasing hepatic metabolism, extraction and clearance.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> may alter <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacodynamics, increasing clinical effects.
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics are independent of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity and gastrointestinal drug transport: insights from <START:DRUG> methadone <END> interactions with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> clearance is highly variable, and drug interactions are problematic.
Both have been attributed to CYP3A, but actual mechanisms are unknown.
Drug interactions can provide such mechanistic information.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , one of the earliest protease inhibitor combinations, may inhibit CYP3A.
We assessed <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> effects on <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, and intestinal transporters (P-glycoprotein) activity.
CYP3A and transporters were assessed with <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> and <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> , respectively.
Twelve healthy human immunodeficiency virus-negative volunteers underwent a sequential three-part crossover.
On three consecutive days, they received oral <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> / <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> , intravenous <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> , and intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) <START:DRUG> methadone <END> , repeated after acute (3 days) and steady-state (2 weeks) <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> .
Plasma and urine analytes were measured by mass spectrometry.
Opioid effects were assessed by miosis.
Inhibition of both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A activity is responsible for <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> drug interactions.
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> disposition was unchanged, despite profound inhibition of CYP3A activity, suggesting little or no role for CYP3A in clinical <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism and clearance.
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> bioavailability was unchanged, despite inhibition of gastrointestinal P-glycoprotein activity, suggesting that this transporter does not limit <START:DRUG> methadone <END> intestinal absorption.
 <START:DRUG> alfentanil <END> apparent oral clearance was inhibited more than 97% by both acute and steady-state <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , and systemic clearance was inhibited more than 90% due to diminished hepatic and intestinal extraction.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> increased <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve four- to five-fold, suggesting significant inhibition of gastrointestinal P-glycoprotein.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> slightly increased <START:DRUG> methadone <END> N-demethylation, but it had no significant effects on <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentrations or on systemic or apparent oral clearance, renal clearance, hepatic extraction or clearance, or bioavailability.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> / <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> had no significant effects on <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma concentration-effect relationships.
Model-based approach to characterize <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> autoinduction and concurrent enzyme induction with <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> .
Characterization of the time course and magnitude of enzyme induction due to multiple inducers is important for interpretation of clinical data from drug-drug interaction studies.
A population interaction model was developed to quantify <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> autoinduction and further induction with concurrent <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> coadministration.
 <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> concentration data in the absence and presence of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> following single- and multiple-dose oral administrations in healthy subjects were used for model development.
The proposed model was able to describe the time-dependent <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> autoinduction and the further induction with <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> when the agents were combined.
The estimated population averages of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> oral clearance were 5.5, 9.4, 14.4, and 16.7 liters/h on days 1, 14, and 35 and at steady state for the interaction, respectively, for <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by the coadministration of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> for 3 weeks.
The estimated times to 50% of the steady state for <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> autoinduction and for the induction resulting from the concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> were similar (around 10 to 12 days).
With this model-based analysis, <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> exposures can be projected prior to and at the steady state of induction, allowing a better understanding of the time course and magnitude of enzyme induction.
Effects of <START:DRUG> allicin <END> on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity in healthy volunteers with different CYP2C19 genotypes.
To investigate the interaction between <START:DRUG> allicin <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and to observe the effects of <START:DRUG> allicin <END> on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity in healthy Chinese male volunteers with different CYP2C19 genotypes.
Eighteen subjects (six CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1, four CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2, two CYP2C19*1/ CYP2C19*3, and six CYP2C19*2/ CYP2C19*2) were enrolled in a two-phase randomized crossover trial.
In each phase, all subjects received placebo or a 180 mg <START:DRUG> allicin <END> capsule once daily for 14 consecutive days.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (20 mg orally on day 15) was determined for up to 12 h following administration by high-performance liquid chromatography.
However, no pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly changed by <START:DRUG> allicin <END> in CYP2C19*2/CYP2C19*2.
The C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfone were unchanged in all three genotypes.
 <START:DRUG> allicin <END> did not significantly affect the activity of CYP3A4 in all subjects.
In carriers of the CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1 and CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2 or *3 genotype, <START:DRUG> allicin <END> treatment increased the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> by 49.7 +/- 7.2 (p < 0.001) and 54.2 +/- 9.2% (p < 0.001), and increased the area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> by 48.1 +/- 9.0 (p = 0.001) and 73.6 +/- 26.7% (p < 0.001), respectively.
The ratio of AUC(0-infinity) of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (a marker for CYP2C19 activity) decreased significantly (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively).
 <START:DRUG> allicin <END> reduced the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> by inhibiting CYP2C19 activity in individuals with the CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1 and CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2 or *3 genotypes, but not in those with the CYP2C19*2/ CYP2C19*2 genotype.
Effect of <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> on the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme system.
The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme is responsible for metabolizing approximately 25% of pharmaceutical agents.
Individuals with impaired CYP2D6 metabolism and those concomitantly receiving agents that inhibit CYP2D6 can have variations in concentrations of such medications and their metabolites.
Five studies assessing the interaction between <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> and CYP2D6 are reviewed.
Study 1 compared <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) after administration of 100 mg of <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> or 75 mg of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> extended release (ER).
Studies 2 to 5 assessed the effect of concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> 100 mg (studies 2, 4, and 5) or 400 mg (study 3), <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> (20 mg, study 4), and <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> (30 mg twice daily; study 5) on the CYP2D6 probe <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
In study 1, there was no significant difference in mean <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> AUC between the CYP2D6 EMs and PMs (-11%; P=0.641) who were administered <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> .
However, PMs receiving <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> ER had significantly higher <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and lower <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> AUCs compared with EMs (+350% and -74%, respectively; P<0.001 for each).
Based on the findings presented here, <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> is expected to have a low risk for variability in efficacy and safety/tolerability resulting from CYP2D6 polymorphisms or drug-drug interactions when coadministered with CYP2D6 substrates or inhibitors.
In studies 2, 4, and 5, the mean increases in <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> AUC with concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> 100 mg ranged from 17% to 36%; the increase with concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> 400 mg (study 3) was 90%.
 <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> and <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> produced increases in mean <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> AUC of 419% and 122%, respectively, which were significantly greater than the increases seen with <START:DRUG> desvenlafaxine <END> 100 mg (P<0.001 for each comparison).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, moderatelyincreases plasma concentrations of oral <START:DRUG> morphine <END> .
Individual variation in opioid response is considerable, partly due to pharmacokinetic factors.
Transporter proteins are becoming increasingly interesting also in the pharmacokinetics of opioids.
The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein can affect gastrointestinal absorption and tissue distribution, particularly brain access of many opioids.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , which is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, would change the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamics of oral <START:DRUG> morphine <END> .
Twelve healthy male volunteers ingested, in a randomized crossover study, once daily 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo for 4 days.
On day 4, 1 h after the last pre-treatment dose, the subjects ingested 0.3 mg/kg <START:DRUG> morphine <END> .
Blood samples for the determination of plasma <START:DRUG> morphine <END> , <START:DRUG> morphine <END> -3-glucuronide (M3G), <START:DRUG> morphine <END> -6-glucuronide (M6G) and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> concentrations were drawn up to 48 h after <START:DRUG> morphine <END> ingestion.
Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated using a questionnaire, visual analogue scales, a reaction time test, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and the Critical Flicker Fusion Test.
A possible improvement of <START:DRUG> morphine <END> penetration to the brain could not be observed.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-9)] of <START:DRUG> morphine <END> by 29%(P=0.002), its AUC(0-48) by 22% (P=0.013) and its peak plasma concentration by 28% (P=0.035).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic variables of M3G or M6G or the pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> morphine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> moderatelyincreases plasma concentrations of oral <START:DRUG> morphine <END> , probably by enhancing its absorption by inhibiting intestinal wall P-glycoprotein.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increases while <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreases plasma <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> concentrations.
This study investigated the effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and CYP3A4, and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , an inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> .
Twelve healthy volunteers in a crossover study ingested 15 mg of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> without pretreatment (control), after <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> pretreatment, and after <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment.
The plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> , <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) generation were monitored.
Lowered plasma <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> concentrations during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase were associated with decreased pharmacodymic effects of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> , as observed by weaker inhibition of TxB(2) synthesis compared to the control and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> phases.
Compared to the control phase, <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 72 h (AUC(0-72)) of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> by 47% (P < 0.001) and prolonged its mean half-life (t(1/2)) by 51% (P < 0.01), without affecting its mean peak concentration (C(max)).
In contrast, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreased the mean AUC(0-72) and C(max) of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> by 37% (P < 0.001) and by 64% (P < 0.001), respectively, and prolonged its t(1/2) and time to C(max).
The plasma protein unbound fraction of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> was unchanged by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> , whereas <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , unexpectedly, decreases plasma <START:DRUG> meloxicam <END> concentrations, possibly by impairing its absorption.
 <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> induces CYP2B6-mediated hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> in healthy subjects.
To characterize the effect of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> on <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation as a marker of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 activity in healthy subjects.
Thirteen subjects received a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> SR 150 mg before and after 2 weeks of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> administration for comparison of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> and hydroxybupropion pharmacokinetics.
 <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> plasma concentrations were also assessed.
Subjects were genotyped for CYP2B6 (G516T, C1459T, and A785G), CYP3A4 (A-392G), CYP3A5 (A6986G), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (C3435T).
None of the CYP2B6 or CYP3A genotypes evaluated were associated with a difference in <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> or <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> clearance.
The 2 individuals homozygous for multidrug resistance protein 1 3435-T/T had 2.5- and 1.8-fold greater <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> clearance, respectively, relative to C/C and C/T individuals (P<0.05).
The area under the concentration vs. time curve ratio of hydroxybupropion: <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> increased 2.3-fold after <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> administration (P=0.0001).
 <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> area under the concentration vs. time curve and Cmax decreased by 55% and 34%, respectively (P<0.002).
Our results confirm that <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> induces CYP2B6 enzyme activity in vivo, as demonstrated by an increase in <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation after 2 weeks of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> administration.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> drastically increases exposure to oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
We investigated the effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Twelve healthy subjects ingested either <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or placebo for 4 days in a randomized, cross-over study.
On day 3, they ingested 10 mg <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Timed plasma samples were collected for the measurement of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> , noroxycodone, <START:DRUG> oxymorphone <END> , noroxymorphone and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> up to 48 h, and pharmacodynamic effects were recorded.
Clinically, lower doses of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> may be needed during <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> treatment to avoid opioid-related adverse effects especially after repeated dosing.
When <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> was taken at the same time as <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> , the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> increased 3.6-fold (range 2.7- to 5.6-fold), peak plasma concentration 1.7-fold and elimination half-life 2.0-fold (p < 0.001) when compared to placebo.
The AUC(0-infinity) ratio of noroxycodone to <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> was decreased by 92% (p < 0.001), and that of <START:DRUG> oxymorphone <END> increased by 108% (p < 0.01).
Pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> were modestly increased by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> inhibits the CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> , drastically increasing exposure to oral <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> when co-administered with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> in TB/HIV co-infected patients: pharmacogenetic effect of CYP2B6 variation.
The goal of this study was to determine the effect of CYP2B6 genetic variation on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (600 mg/d) in TB/HIV co-infected patients receiving concomitant <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , a potent CYP inducer.
In the 26 patients studied, CYP2B6 c.516GG, GT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.27, 0.50, and 0.23, respectively.
Mean plasma <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> area under the curve was significantly higher in patients with CYP2B6 c.516TT than in those with GT (107 vs 27.6 microg x h/mL, P< .0001) or GG genotype (107 vs 23.0 microg x h/mL, P< .0001).
Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was significantly lower in patients with CYP2B6 c.516TT than in those with GT genotype (2.1 vs 8.4 mL/min/kg, P<0.0001) and GG genotype (2.1 vs 9.9 mL/min/kg, P< .0001).
No differences in <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> exposure or CL/F existed between patients with CYP2B6 c.516GT and GG genotypes.
Our results indicate that CYP2B6 c.516TT genotype can be used to identify <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> poor metabolizers in patients co-treated with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in plasma and saliva in humans: usefulness of saliva as matrix for CYP3A phenotyping.
To compare <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> kinetics between plasma and saliva and to find out whether saliva is suitable for CYP3A phenotyping.
This was a two way cross-over study in eight subjects treated with 2 mg <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> IV or 7.5 mg orally under basal conditions and after CYP3A induction with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> .
Under basal conditions and IV administration, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and 1'-hydroxymidazolam (plasma, saliva), 4-hydroxymidazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam-glucuronide (plasma) were detectable.
There was a significant correlation between the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> concentrations in plasma and saliva (basal conditions: r = 0.864, P < 0.0001; after <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> : r = 0.842, P < 0.0001).
After oral administration and basal conditions, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam were detectable in plasma and saliva.
The parameters separating best between basal conditions and post- <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> were: (1'-hydroxymidazolam + 1'-hydroxymidazolam-glucuronide)/ <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> at 20-30 min (plasma) and the AUC of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (saliva) after IV, and the AUC of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (plasma) and of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (plasma and saliva) after oral administration.
Saliva appears to be a suitable matrix for non-invasive CYP3A phenotyping using <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> as a probe drug, but sensitive analytical methods are required.
After <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , the AUC of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> [mean differences plasma 53.7 (95% CI 4.6, 102.9) and saliva 0.83 (95% CI 0.52, 1.14) ng ml(-1) h] and 1'-hydroxymidazolam [mean difference plasma 11.8 (95% CI 7.9 , 15.7) ng ml(-1) h] had decreased significantly.
After treatment with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , the AUC of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> [mean difference plasma 104.5 (95% CI 74.1, 134.9) ng ml(-1) h] and 1'-hydroxymidazolam [mean differences plasma 51.9 (95% CI 34.8, 69.1) and saliva 2.3 (95% CI 1.9, 2.7) ng ml(-1) h] had decreased significantly.
The role of cytochrome P2C19 in R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> pharmacokinetics and its interaction with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
Previous studies reported <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and suggested the pharmacokinetic interaction of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> with R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
The aim of this study was to compare possible effects of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> between CYP2C19 genotypes.
Seventeen subjects, of whom 10 were homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs) and seven were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, were enrolled in this randomized crossover study, and they ingested 20 mg <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> or placebo once daily for 11 days.
On day 7, they administered a single dose of 10 mg racemic <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
The plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> enantiomers and prothrombin time expressed as international normalized ratio were monitored up to 120 hours.
During the placebo phase, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t1/2) of R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> in PMs was significantly greater than those in hmEMs (AUC[0-infinity], 42,938/34,613 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM], P = 0.004; t1/2, 48.8/40.8 hours [PM/hmEM], P = 0.013).
There were no differences in S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> pharmacokinetics between the CYP2C19 genotypes (AUC[0-infinity], 15,851/16,968 ng*h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 22.7/25.4 h [PM/hmEM]), or between the two treatment phases (AUC[0-infinity], 14,756/18,166 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 27.0/25.4 hours [PM/hmEM] in the <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> phase) as well as anticoagulant effects.
These results indicate that CYP2C19 activity was one of determinants on the R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> disposition because the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> enantiomers were different between the CYP2C19 genotypes and the <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> affected the R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 in only hmEMs.
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> treatment significantly increased the AUC(0-infinity) (41,387 ng h/mL, P = 0.004) and t1/2(46.4 hours, P = 0.017) of R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> in hmEMs to levels comparable to those in the PMs.
However, the phamacodynamic effect of the interaction of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> would be of minor clinical significance.
Determinants of steady-state <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> pharmacokinetics: impact of pharmacogenetic factors, gender and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
 <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> is frequently used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.
However, the determinants of <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> pharmacokinetics in patients during steady-state conditions are largely unknown.
We therefore explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (SLCO1B1), gender, and the effects of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> comedication on the interindividual variability of steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> .
Twenty-four patients receiving stable medication with <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> 10 mg once daily and with an indication for additional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment to control hypertension or to treat heart failure were selected.
Blood samples were taken before <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration.
After this first study period, patients received either <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> 150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) or <START:DRUG> losartan <END> 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once daily.
After 3 days of ARB medication, eight blood samples were again collected at the timepoints indicated above.
The patients' long-term medications, which did not include known CYP2C9 inhibitors, were maintained at a constant dose during the study.
All patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*1/*1 [n=15]; *1/*2 [n = 4]; *1/*3 [n=5]) as well as for SLCO1B1 (c.521TT [n=13]; c.521TC [n=11]).
Factorial ANOVA revealed an independent impact of the CYP2C9 genotype (dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the 24-hour dosing interval at steady state [AUC(24,ss)/D]: *1/*1 375.5+/-151.4 microg x h/L/mg vs *1/*3 548.5+/-271.6 microg x h/L/mg, p=0.001), the SLCO1B1 genotype (AUC(24,ss)/D: TT 352.3+/-114 microg x h/L/mg vs TC 487.6+/-218.4 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.05) and gender (AUC(24,ss)/D: males 359.5+/-72.2 microg x h/L/mg vs females 547.3+/-284 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.01) on disposition of <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> .
This study shows that the CYP2C9*3 and SLCO1B1 c.521TC genotype and female gender are significant and independent predictors of the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> .
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> caused a 13% increase in the AUC(24,ss)/D of <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> (p=0.002), whereas <START:DRUG> losartan <END> had no effect.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> yields moderate but significant increases in the <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> plasma concentration and elimination half-life.
Effects of CYP3A4 inducers with and without CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> in healthy volunteers.
To assess the potential of known CYP3A4 inducers, with and without CYP3A4 inhibitors, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> .
Two separate, open, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in healthy subjects.
Study 1 was a 28-day parallel-group study with three treatment groups of 12 subjects each.
On days 1-7, all subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> 100 mg b.i.d.; on days 8-21, subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> 100 mg b.i.d.
plus either <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> 600 mg q.d., <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (EFV) 600 mg q.d., or placebo q.d.
as assigned; on days 22-28, the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose was increased to 200 mg b.i.d.
for patients receiving either <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> or EFV.
Study 2 was a 21-day, two-way crossover study with three cohorts (12 subjects per cohort).
On days 1-21, subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> 300 mg b.i.d.
and boosted <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> ( <START:DRUG> lPV/r <END> , <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> 400 mg + <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 100 mg) or placebo b.i.d.
in cohort 1, <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> 100 mg b.i.d.
and boosted <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> ( <START:DRUG> sQV/r <END> , <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> 1000 mg + <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 100 mg) or placebo b.i.d.
in cohort 2, and <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> 100 mg b.i.d.
and 1000 mg <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> + <START:DRUG> lPV/r <END> (400 mg/100 mg) or placebo b.i.d.
in cohort 3.
On days 8-21, subjects in all three cohorts also received EFV 600 mg or placebo q.d.
"
 <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> AUC(12) and C(max) approached preinduction values when the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose was increased to 200 mg b.i.d.
for both the <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> -treated and EFV-treated groups.
No pharmacokinetic data are reported for cohort 3 because all subjects were discontinued during period 1 due to poor toleration of the drug regimen.
There were no serious adverse events reported in either study, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.
Upward adjustment of the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose during co-administration with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> or EFV appears to compensate for this reduction.
Protease inhibitors (PIs) significantly increased <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure; however, the addition of EFV to the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> + PI regimens reduced the magnitude of PI-mediated increase in <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure (by approximately 50%), but the net effect was still CYP3A4 inhibition.
 <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (100 mg b.i.d.) exposure (AUC(12) and C(max)) was reduced in the presence of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and EFV by approximately 70% and 50%, respectively.
Co-administration of <START:DRUG> lPV/r <END> with <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (300 mg b.i.d.) resulted in geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 395% and 197% for <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> AUC(12) and C(max), respectively, compared with placebo; addition of EFV resulted in GMRs of 253% and 125% for AUC(12) and C(max), respectively.
Co-administration of <START:DRUG> sQV/r <END> with <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (100 mg b.i.d.) resulted in GMRs of 977% and 478% for <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> AUC(12) and C(max), respectively, compared with placebo; addition of EFV resulted in GMRs of 500% and 226% for AUC(12) and C(max), respectively.
As expected with a CYP3A4 substrate, <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure (C(max) and AUC(12)) was significantly reduced by the known CYP3A4 inducers, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and EFV, by approximately 70% and 50%, respectively.
Effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> in healthy volunteers.
To evaluate the influence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors on the clinical pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> , a novel CCR5 antagonist.
Four open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in healthy subjects to assess the effect of separate and distinct combinations of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> .
Study 1 was a two-way crossover study investigating the influence of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> (SQV; 1200 mg t.i.d.) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (400 mg q.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (100 mg b.i.d.).
All subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> for 7 days in both study periods.
Cohort 1 subjects also received SQV or placebo and cohort 2 subjects also received <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or placebo.
Study 2 was a parallel-group study including four treatment groups investigating the effects of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> ( <START:DRUG> lPV/r <END> ; 400 mg/100 mg b.i.d.), <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> ( <START:DRUG> sQV/r <END> ; 1000 mg/100 mg b.i.d.), and low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (RTV; 100 mg b.i.d.) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (100 mg b.i.d.), and exploring whether <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose adjustment can compensate for interaction effects.
Treatment lasted 28 days and comprised three distinct phases: (i) <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> alone on days 1-7; (ii) <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> + interactant on days 8-21; and (iii) <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (adjusted dose) + interactant on days 22-28.
Study 3 was a two-way crossover study investigating the effects of <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> (ATZ; 400 mg q.d.) and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> atazanavir <END> (ATZ/r; 300 mg/100 mg b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (300 mg b.i.d.).
All subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> on days 1-14 of both study periods.
Subjects also received ATZ on days 1-7 and ATZ/r on days 8-14 of one treatment period, and placebo on days 1-14 of the other treatment period.
Study 4 was a two-way crossover study investigating the effects of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> -boosted <START:DRUG> tipranavir <END> ( <START:DRUG> tPV/r <END> ; 500 mg/200 mg b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> (150 mg b.i.d.).
Subjects received <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> plus <START:DRUG> tPV/r <END> or placebo on days 1-8.
All of the drugs/drug combinations tested (except for <START:DRUG> tPV/r <END> ) increased <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure, albeit to different degrees of magnitude.
Downward adjustment of the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose in study 2 during co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors was able to compensate for the interactions.
 <START:DRUG> tPV/r <END> had no clinically relevant effect on <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure at steady state.
There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events in any of the studies, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, including <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and protease inhibitors (except <START:DRUG> tPV/r <END> ), increase <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure.
Downward adjustment of the <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> dose during co-administration with protease inhibitors can compensate for the interaction.
 <START:DRUG> sQV/r <END> caused the largest increase in <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure (8.3-fold increase in AUC(tau)), whereas RTV caused the smallest increase in <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> exposure (2.6-fold increase in AUC(tau)).
TPV/rTPV/r does not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> maraviroc <END> , and hence no dose adjustment would be warranted.
The different effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> enantiomers.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Recently, we have shown that the plasma concentration of R- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> is greater than that of the S-enantiomer.
Although <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> co-administration is known to increase the bioavailability of a racemic mixture of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> , little is known about the stereoselective inhibition of P-gp activity by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
This study indicates that the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> are due to P-gp-mediated transport and its stereoselectivity is altered by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a an inhibitor of P-gp.
The aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> .
A two-way double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed with a 2-week washout period.
Twelve healthy volunteers received either <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> 200 mg or matched placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> 60 mg simultaneously.
The plasma concentrations and the amount of urinary excretion (Ae) of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> enantiomers were measured up to 24 h after dosing.
After placebo administration, mean AUC(0,24 h) of S- and R- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> was 474 ng ml(-1) h (95% CI 311, 638) and 798 ng ml(-1) h (95% CI 497, 1101), respectively.
However, further study will be needed because the different affinities of the two enantiomers for P-gp have not been supported by in vitro studies.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> affected the pharmacokinetic parameters of S- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> more, and increased AUC(0,24 h) of S- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> and R- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> by 4.0-fold (95% CI of differences 2.8, 5.3; P < 0.001) and by 3.1-fold (95% CI of differences 2.2, 4.0; P = 0.014), respectively, and Ae(0,24 h) of S- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> and R- <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> by 3.6-fold (95% CI of differences 2.6, 4.5; P < 0.001) and by 2.9-fold (95% CI of differences 2.1, 3.8; P < 0.001), respectively.
Additionally, the R : S ratio for AUC(0,24 h) and Ae(0,24 h) were significantly reduced in the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase, while t(max), t(1/2) and renal clearance were constant during the study.
This study indicates that the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fexofenadine <END> are due to P-gp-mediated transport and its stereoselectivity is altered by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a P-gp inhibitor.
Drug interaction between oral <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> in healthy subjects: effects of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and norverapamil.
It has been reported that <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> are inhibitors of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4.
Thus, it could be expected that <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> would alter the absorption and metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared after oral administration of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> (60 mg) in the presence or absence of oral <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (40 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers.
Thus, the relative bioavailability increased by the same magnitude with <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> were significantly altered by the coadministration of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> compared with those of without <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
For example, the total area under the plasma-concentration time curve to the last measured time, 24 h, in plasma (AUC(0-24) (h)) of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> increased significantly by 42.8%.
Although the AUC(0-24) (h) of norverapamil was not significantly different between two groups of humans, the AUC(0-24) (h, norverapamil)/ AUC(0-24) (h, <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> ) ratio was significantly reduced (27.5% decrease) with <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
The above data suggest that <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> could inhibit the absorption of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> via inhibition of P-gp and/or the metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> by CYP3A4 in humans.
Effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , an inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> .
The authors studied the effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , a dual inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> in humans.
Ten healthy male subjects were treated daily for 7 days with 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or with placebo.
On day 6, a single dose of 1 mg <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> was administered.
Plasma <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations were measured.
Thus, <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the exposure to <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , probably because of a decrease in its bioavailability through the induction of CYP3A and probably P-glycoprotein.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 51% for <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , by 43% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and by 45% for the active moieties ( <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> + 9-hydroxyrisperidone).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> also decreased the peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> by 38%, 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 46%, and the active moieties by 41%.
The apparent oral clearance of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> approximately doubled after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism and potentiation of its effects by <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> in routinely treated patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
To investigate the influence of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> on <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> concentrations and its effect in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are routinely given <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> as a co-treatment of depression.
We recruited 17 depressed AMI patients who received <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> as a routine part of their therapy (mean dose 75 +/- 39 mg/day).
Patients were genotyped for CYP2D6 3, 4 and gene duplication.
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> and alpha-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> were analyzed in plasma 0, 2, 6 and 12 h post-dose.
Heart rates (HR) at rest were registered after each sampling.
 <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> 20 mg daily was then administered, and all measurements were repeated on day 8.
All patients were genotypically extensive metabolizers (EMs) (nine with 1/1 and eight with 1/3 or 4).
Mean HRs were significantly lower after the study week at each time point.
Mean area under the HR versus time curve (AUEC) decreased (835 +/- 88 to 728 +/- 84 beats x h/min; P = 0.0007).
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> AUCs correlated with patients' AUECs at the baseline (Spearman r = -0.64, P < 0.01), but not on the eighth day of the study.
A reduction of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> dose was required in two patients due to excessive bradycardia and severe orthostatic hypotension.
No other adverse effects of the drugs were identified.
We suggest, however, that the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> dose is controlled upon initiation and withdrawal of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
Following the administration of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , mean <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased ( 1064 +/- 1213 to 4476 +/- 2821 nM x h/mg per kg, P = 0.0001), while metabolite AUCs decreased (1492 +/- 872 to 348 +/- 279 n M x h/mg per kg, P < 0.0001), with an increase of metabolic ratios (MR) (0.9 +/- 1.3 to 26 +/- 29; P < 0.0001).
A pronounced inhibition of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism by <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> was observed in AMI patients, but without serious adverse effects.
Effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> .
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, mainly by CYP2C9.
Our objective was to study the effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of several CYP enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> .
This study had a two-way, open, crossover design and included 10 healthy CAUCasian male subjects.
In the control phase, the subjects ingested a single 50-mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> .
In the <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> phase, the subjects ingested <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily on the second day, and 50 mg <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> was given 1 h after the last dose of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
Plasma <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> concentrations were determined for up to 24 h post-dose.
The inhibition of CYP2C9, and to some extent that of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes during the first-pass metabolism of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> seems to be involved in the interaction.
The clinical importance of the interaction between <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> remains to be studied, but lower doses of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> may be adequate for patients receiving <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
In the <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> was 178% (95% CI 143-212%; P < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration was 214% (95% CI 128-300%; P < 0.05) of the respective control value.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> did not affect significantly the elimination half-life or time to maximum concentration of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> .
The renal clearance of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> was decreased by 47% (95% CI -76% to -16%; P < 0.01) by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increased exposure to <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , probably mainly by inhibition of its cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> at steady state in healthy male subjects.
A randomized, placebo-controlled (with respect to <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> ), 2-period, multiple-dose intragroup fixed-dose sequence study was conducted in 34 healthy male subjects to evaluate the interactions between <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (triazole antifungal agent) and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (reverse transcriptase inhibitor).
In period 1, subjects received 200 mg twice-daily (bid) <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (n = 17) or placebo (n = 17) for 3 days (400-mg bid loading doses on day 1).
Then <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> was coadministered with 200 mg bid <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or placebo for the next 9 days (days 21-29).
Serial plasma <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> concentrations were measured on days 3, 19, and 29, and the safety data were collected throughout the study.
The increase in <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> exposure during coadministration is probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
In period 2, following a 7-day washout, subjects received 400 mg once-daily (qd) <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> alone for 10 days (days 11-20).
The 400-mg qd <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> dose substantially reduced the steady-state mean <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-12) by 80% (90% confidence interval [CI], 75%-84%) and peak concentration (Cmax) by 66%(90% CI, 57%-73%).
The decrease in <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> exposure during coadministration is probably mainly due to the induction of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 by <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> .
The 200 mg bid <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increased the steady-state mean AUC0-24 and Cmax of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> by 43% (90% CI, 36%-51%) and 37% (90% CI, 29%-46%), respectively.
Coadministration of 200 mg bid <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> with 400 mg (or higher) qd <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> is contraindicated due to the clinically significant effect of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> on <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> pharmacokinetics.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> , a broad-spectrum anthelminthic, has been reported to undergo extensive first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, is known to markedly increase plasma concentrations of many co-administered drugs.
However, no data are available on the potential pharmacokinetic drug interaction between <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in humans.
To investigate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in healthy adult Thai male volunteers.
In an open-label, randomized two-phase crossover study, separated by a 2-week period, 10 healthy adult Thai male volunteers ingested a single dose of 20 mg/kg <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> alone or with co-administration of 400-mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> orally daily for 5 days.
Venous blood samples were collected at specific times for a 24-h period.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.
A non-compartmental model was applied for pharmacokinetic parameter analysis of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> .
Our data suggest that when <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> is co-administered with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , the dose of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> could be reduced to half the standard dose of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> to reduce the cost of therapy.
Concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> significantly increased the mean area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-alpha)) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> by 93% (955.94 +/- 307.74 vs. 1843.10 +/- 336.39 ng h/mL; P < 0.01) and 102% (183.38 +/- 43.90 vs. 371.31 +/- 44.63 ng/mL; P < 0.01), respectively, whereas the mean total clearance (CL/F) of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> was significantly decreased by 58% (2.65 +/- 0.64 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.35 mL/h/kg; P < 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> co-administration alters the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in humans, possibly through inhibition of CYP3A, particularly CYP3A4, first-pass metabolism of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> is a widely used opioid analgesic, which is extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A.
Recent reports suggest that concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors with <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> may lead to dangerous drug interactions.
The potential interactions of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> with triazole antifungal agents <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> were studied in a randomized crossover study in three phases.
Twelve healthy volunteers were given 5 microg/kg of intravenous <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> without pretreatment (control), after oral <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (400 mg twice on the first day and 200 mg twice on the second day), or after oral <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> (400 mg once on the first day and 200 mg once on the second day).
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> , norfentanyl, <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> were determined up to 24 h.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using compartmental methods.
The initial plasma concentrations and volume of distribution of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> did not differ significantly between phases.
Caution should be exercised, especially in patients who are given <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> during long-lasting <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> treatment, because insidiously elevated <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> concentration may lead to respiratory depression.
The mean plasma clearance of intravenous <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> was decreased by 23% (range -22 to 48%; p < 0.05) and 16% (-34 to 53%; p < 0.05) after <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> administration, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> increased the area under the <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> plasma concentration-time curve by 1.4-fold (p < 0.05).
Both <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> delay the elimination of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> significantly.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and the CYP2C8*3 allele have opposite effects on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
We studied the effects of the CYP2C8 inhibitor <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and CYP2C8 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the antidiabetic <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
In a randomized crossover study, 16 healthy volunteers with the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)1 (n = 8), (*)1/(*)3 (n = 5), or (*)3/(*)3 (n = 3) genotype ingested 160 mg of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> or placebo twice daily for 6 days.
On day 3, they ingested 15 mg of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
The effects of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> were characterized in vitro.
During the placebo phase, the weight-adjusted AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> was 34% smaller in the CYP2C8(*)3/(*)3 group and 26% smaller in the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)3 group than in the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)1 group (p < 0.05).
In conclusion, drug interactions and pharmacogenetics affecting the CYP2C8 enzyme may change the safety of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> raised the area under the plasma <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) by 42% (p < 0.001) and decreased the formation rates of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> metabolites M-IV and M-III (p < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> inhibited M-IV formation in vitro (inhibition constant 38.2 muM), predicting the in vivo interaction.
A phase I study of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> modulation in patients with advanced cancers.
The aims were to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> with CYP3A inhibition by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , and to correlate the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> phenotyping of CYP3A activity.
Forty-one patients with refractory metastatic cancers were treated with an escalating dose of intravenous <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> once in every 3 week of 10 mg/m(2), concurrently with oral <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 200 mg twice daily for 3 days starting 2 days before the administration of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> phenotyping test with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> modulation was performed before the first cycle of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
 <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> pharmacokinetics were compared to our previous study of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> treatment without <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> modulation.
Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity.
The maximum tolerated dose was 70 mg with mean AUC at 70 mg similar to 75 mg/m(2) of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> without <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance correlated with renal function and maximum concentration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , but not <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> clearance or other variables of hepatic function.
Fixed dosing was found to be feasible, without increased variability of clearance or neutrophil toxicity compared to BSA-based dosing.
With <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> modulation, <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance correlated with renal function but not CYP3A phenotype.
The plasma clearances of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> were reduced by 1.7- and 6-folds, respectively.
The variability of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> AUC was reduced from 157 to 67%, but variability of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance was not reduced by CYP3A inhibition.
Effect of <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of the antidepressant <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> .
This study investigated the effect of <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in healthy volunteers.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were measured after ingestion of 75 mg <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> without pretreatment (control), after <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> pretreatment, or after <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> pretreatment.
The most likely mechanism for the interaction between <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> and <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> is the inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> , whereas the minor effects of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> are probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> .
During the <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was on average 490% (P<0.001) and that of ODV 57% (P<0.001) of the corresponding control value.
 <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> decreased the AUC(0-infinity) ratio of ODV over <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> by 82% (P<0.001).
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> slightly increased the sum of AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> plus AUC(0-infinity) of ODV (active moiety) by 31% (P<0.001).
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> increase the exposure to oral <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> .
We assessed the effect of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> .
Twelve healthy volunteers took 5 mg of oral <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> in a randomised order on three study sessions: without pretreatment, after oral <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily on the second day, or after oral <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> 400 mg on the first day and 200 mg on the second day.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> and N-desmethyldiazepam were determined for up to 48 h.
Pharmacodynamic variables were measured for 12 h.
This was associated with the prolongation of the mean elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 31 h to 61 h (p < 0.01) after <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
The pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> were changed only modestly.
Recurrent administration of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> increases the risk of clinically significant interactions during <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> treatment, because the elimination of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> is impaired significantly.
In the <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> phase, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC 0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> was increased (geometric mean ratio) 2.2-fold (p < 0.05; 90% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 2.82).
In the <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> phase, the AUC 0-infinity of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> was increased 2.5-fold (p < 0.01; 90% CI 1.94 to 3.40), and the t(1/2) was prolonged from 31 h to 73 h (p < 0.001).
The peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> was practically unchanged by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
Both <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> considerably increase the exposure to <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> hydrochloride, a new calcimimetic agent, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> : in vitro and clinical studies.
 <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> hydrochloride ( <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> ) is a positive allosteric modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients.
In vitro study has demonstrated that <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 with a K(i) value of 0.087 micromol/L, which is comparable to the well-known potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (0.064 micromol/L).
A clinical study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> on CYP2D6 substrates in healthy volunteers.
Each subject received 50 mg of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> or a matched placebo orally once daily for 8 days with 30 mg of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> coadministered on day 8.
Therefore, during concomitant treatment with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> , it may be necessary to consider making dose adjustments for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6.
The mean AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> increased 11- and 7-fold, respectively, in extensive metabolizers when coadministered with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> versus placebo.
Steady-state pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> in healthy male subjects.
Since there is a likelihood of coadministration of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , two studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of drug interaction.
Study A was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period, parallel-group trial (n = 34).
Study B had the same design without the placebo group (n = 17).
In period 1, subjects received 200 mg <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or placebo twice daily (BID) for 3 days (400 mg BID on day 1).
In period 2, following a 7-day washout, subjects received <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> alone at 400 mg BID (study A) or 100 mg BID (study B) for 10 days (days 11 to 20), and then <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was coadministered with 200 mg BID <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or placebo for the next 10 days (days 21 to 30).
Serial plasma samples were collected on days 3, 20, and 30, and safety data were collected throughout the study.
However, the effect of low-dose (100 mg BID) <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was less pronounced (AUC(0-12), -39%; C(max), -24%).
It is interesting that one subject in each study exhibited the opposite effect of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> exposure (a 2.5- to 3-fold increase), probably due to lack of CYP2C19.
The safety profile of combination therapy was not notably different from that of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> alone.
Due to the significant effect of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> exposure, coadministration of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> with 400 mg BID <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> is contraindicated; coadministration with 100 mg BID <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use.
High-dose (400 mg BID) <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> substantially reduced the steady-state mean <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h [AUC(0-12)], -82%; maximum concentration [C(max)], -66%).
The decrease in <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> exposure was probably due to the induction of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 by <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> had no apparent effect on the exposure of high-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> but slightly decreased the exposure of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (AUC(0-12),-14%; C(max), -24%).
Drug interaction assessment following concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> in healthy men.
 <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> is an extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections.
This randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multiple-dose study was conducted in healthy adult volunteers to assess the potential for a drug interaction between <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and the <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> tablet formulation.
Subjects were randomly assigned for 10 days to one of the following treatments: <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> (200 mg once daily), <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> (200 mg once daily), or <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> (200 mg once daily) and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> (200 mg once daily).
Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 10 for pharmacokinetic evaluation of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> concentrations.
A total of 36 healthy men enrolled in the study.
On day 1, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve calculated from time 0-24 h post-dose (AUC(0-24)) were unchanged upon co-administration.
These decreases in exposure corresponded with a 90% increase in steady-state clearance of orally administered <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> .
At steady state (day 10), co-administration of <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> resulted in 44% (p = 0.012) and 52% (p = 0.007) decreases in <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> C(max) and AUC(0-24), respectively.
 <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> C(max) and AUC(0-24) were not significantly altered upon co-administration of the two agents, 24% increase in C(max) (p = 0.196) and 25% increase in AUC(0-24) (p = 0.212) values, although inter-subject variability was observed within this group.
Because co-administration of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> significantly reduces <START:DRUG> posaconazole <END> exposure and increases <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> levels in some subjects, concomitant use of these agents should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk.
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> hydrochloride when administered with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
The calcimimetic <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> hydrochloride ( <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> ) is used for treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease with secondary hyperparathyroidism, a population that commonly receives multiple concurrent medications.
 <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> is eliminated primarily via oxidative metabolism mediated, in part, through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
Thus, the potential for an inhibitor of CYP3A4 to alter the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> is of clinical importance.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> during treatment with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Twenty-four healthy subjects were enrolled in an open-label, crossover, phase I study to receive a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> (90 mg) alone and with 7 days of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (200 mg twice daily).
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected for up to 72 hours postdose.
 <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> plasma concentration-time data were analysed by noncompartmental methods.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were analysed using a crossover ANOVA model that included subjects who completed both treatment arms.
Twenty subjects completed both treatment arms.
The time to reach the maximum plasma concentration was not significantly affected, and the terminal elimination half-lives were similar between treatments.
This suggests that clinicians should monitor parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations when a patient receiving <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> increased 2.3-fold (90% CI 1.92, 2.67) [range 1.15- to 7.12-fold] and the mean maximum plasma concentration increased 2.2-fold (90% CI 1.67, 2.78) [range 0.904- to 10.8-fold] when administered with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , relative to when administered alone.
Co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor moderatelyincreased <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> exposure in study subjects.
Does <START:DRUG> tenofovir <END> influence <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> pharmacokinetics?"
A recent report described a possible interaction between <START:DRUG> tenofovir <END> (TFV) and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (EFV).
Patients developed neuropsychiatric manifestations upon introduction of TFV on a stable EFV-containing regimen.
We evaluated the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction between TFV and EFV by assessing cross-sectional and longitudinal data in 169 individuals receiving EFV.
However, under conditions of limited EFV metabolism, that is, the group of 23 individuals carrying two copies of CYP2B6 loss/diminished-function alleles, plasma AUC values were highest among individuals receiving TFV (n=5, 353,031 ng*h/ml), compared with those not receiving TFV (n=18, 180,689 ng*h/ml).
Statistical analysis identified both a global, sixfold effect of CYP2B6 loss/diminished function (P < 0.0001) and a significant interaction between the number of loss/diminished-function alleles and the co-medication with TFV (P = 0.009).
Although there is no clear evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction between TFV and EFV, we cannot rule out an interaction between these drugs restricted to individuals who are slow EFV metabolizers.
EFV plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels were comparable among individuals receiving (n=18) or not receiving TFV (n=151); 57,962 versus 52,293 ng*h/ml.
Pharmacokinetic effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> succinate (YM905) is a new, once-daily, orally administered muscarinic receptor antagonist designed to treat overactive bladder.
The metabolism of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> involves hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> may be affected by drugs that inhibit CYP3A4.
This study aimed to examine the effects of co-administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> in healthy volunteers.
In a single-site, open-label, monosequence, crossover study, 17 healthy men and women aged 18 to 65 years received a single 10 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> , which is is the highest available dose.
After a 14-day wash-out period, they began 20 days of oral <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> at a dose of 200 mg once daily.
A single 10 mg dose of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> was administered again on day 7 of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment.
Pharmacokinetics was assessed using the standard measurements of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax, area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life (t1/2).
No substantial increase in the overall rate of adverse events, and no significant effects on vital signs, electrocardiography, clinical laboratory values, or physical examinations were noted.
Co-administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> resulted in a 1.43 times increase in the C(max) of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> and an approximately 2 times increase in AUC.
The mean t1/2 of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> was extended from 49.3 to 77.5 hr whereas time to Cmax did not change.
Administration of 200 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> once daily in healthy male volunteers resulted in a 2 times increase in exposure of a single 10 mg dose of <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> .
Since <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> is one of the strongest inhibitors of CYP3A4, it is expected that co-administration of other CYP3A4 inhibitors will not result in a stronger increase in <START:DRUG> solifenacin <END> exposure.
The CYP2C8 inhibitor <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> does not increase the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> is a short acting hypnotic, which is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C8 in vitro.
We studied the possible effect of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , an inhibitor of CYP2C8, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
In a randomised 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, each ingested a 7.5 mg dose of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> and its two primary metabolites, plasma <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , and psychomotor performance were measured.
The effects of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors on the depletion of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (500 nM) were studied in vitro in human liver microsomes.
In vitro, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (1 microM) and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (8 microM) decreased the elimination rate of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> enantiomers by about 65-95%, while <START:DRUG> montelukast <END> (16 microM), <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (200 microM) and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (10 microM) had no appreciable effect.
Accordingly, CYP2C8 does not significantly metabolise <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> in vivo.
The pharmacokinetic variables of the parent <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> were not significantly affected by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raised the mean peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (1.6-fold; P<0.001) and that of N-desmethyl- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (1.2-fold; P<0.001).
The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0)-infinity) values of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> and N-desmethyl- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> were raised 2-fold (P<0.001) and 1.2-fold (P<0.01), respectively.
The renal clearance of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> was reduced by 48% by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (P<0.001).
The pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> , measured using psychometric tests, were not affected by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> does not increase the plasma concentrations of the parent <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
However, as <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raises the concentrations of two potentially active metabolites of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> , slightly enhanced effects of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> can not be excluded.
Cytochrome P450 2B6 activity as measured by <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation: effect of induction by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and ethnicity.
The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 before and after in vivo induction by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) in white subjects and Chinese subjects by use of the probe drug <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> (INN, amfebutamone).
Healthy male white subjects (n = 9) and Chinese subjects (n = 9) (age range, 19-34 years) of known CYP2B6 genotype received orally administered <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> (Zyban SR, 150 mg) alone and during daily treatment with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (600 mg).
Blood samples were taken for up to 72 hours after each <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> dose, and plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> and its active metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion, were measured by HPLC.
The subjects' CYP2B6 genotype was determined by use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay.
There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> or hydroxybupropion between white subjects and Chinese subjects before and after treatment with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , once corrected for body weight.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly inducers CYP2B6 activity in vivo, and the clinical consequences of potential interactions between <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and CYP2B6 substrates deserve further investigation.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> appears to induce the elimination of hydroxybupropion.
Differences in <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> pharmacokinetics that were observed between white subjects and Chinese subjects can be attributed to differences in body weight, suggesting that, for a given subject weight, CYP2B6 activity is similar in white subjects and Chinese subjects.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment increased the apparent clearance of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> in Chinese subjects and white subjects combined (n = 16) from 2.6 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.0 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)) after <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> alone to 7.9 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) (95% CI, 6.8-10.1 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)) during <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment decreased the half-life of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> from 15.9 hours (95% CI, 13.5-20.4 hours) to 8.2 hours (95% CI, 6.7-12.4 hours).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment increased the hydroxybupropion maximum concentration from 395 ng/mL (95% CI, 341-497 ng/mL) to 548 ng/mL (95% CI, 490-638 ng/mL), decreased the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity of hydroxybupropion from 14.7 microg x h/mL (95% CI, 12.7-18.4 microg x h/mL) to 8.4 microg x h/mL (95% CI, 7.4-10.2 microg x h/mL), and reduced the elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion from 21.9 hours (95% CI, 20.3-24.0 hours) to 10.7 hours (95% CI, 8.6-14.5 hours).
Influence of high-dose <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> are characterized by large inter-individual variability in systemic drug exposure (AUC) and drug clearance.
The PK variability is thought to be largely related to differences in the catalytic function of CYP3A, involved in <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism and elimination.
As variability in efficacy and toxicity is associated with variability in <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> AUC and clearance, reducing inter-individual PK variability may help improve the risk-benefit ratio of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> therapy.
We investigated if high-dose <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a potent CYP3A inhibitor, could result in a uniform reduction of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance and reduce the inter-individual variability in <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> AUC and clearance.
Seven patients were treated in a randomized-cross over design with intravenous <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> (100 mg/m(2)) followed 3 weeks later by <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> (15 mg/m(2)) given in combination with orally administered <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (400 mg 3 times daily, up to 47 hours after <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> infusion) or vice versa.
 <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> plasma concentration-time data were described by a three-compartment PK model.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> plasma concentration-time data were described by a one-compartment PK model.
In the presence of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , inter-individual variability in clearance and AUC, expressed as coefficient of variation, was increased from 41.6 to 49.5% and from 28.0 to 35.1%, respectively, and not, as we had hypothesized, reduced.
Inhibition of CYP3A by concomitant high-dose <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administration does not result in a uniform reduction of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance and does not reduce the inter-individual variability in <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> AUC or clearance.
This approach is unsuitable as method to achieve a uniform <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> PK profile.
 <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance was reduced by 50% (P = .018) from 32.8 +/- 13.7 L/hr to 16.5 +/- 8.15 L/hr upon <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> coadministration, albeit with large inter-individual variability (fractional change in clearance, range 0.31 - 0.66).
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> HCl when administered with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> HCl.
In vitro work has demonstrated that <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> on CYP2D6 activity, using <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects.
Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> (90 mg for 7 days).
Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose.
Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms.
The t (max) was similar between the regimens.
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> alone than when receiving <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> or <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> .
This study demonstrates that <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6.
These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> , dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.
Relative to <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> alone, mean AUC and C(max) of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> .
The t (1/2,z) of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> was longer when <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> was coadministered with <START:DRUG> cinacalcet <END> (21.0 versus 43.3 hs).
Combined effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and CYP2D6*10 genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> in healthy subjects.
This study was to evaluate the combined effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and the CYP2D6*10 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> , a substrate of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, in healthy subjects.
Nineteen healthy volunteers whose CYP2D6 genotypes were predetermined were enrolled (9 for CYP2D6*1/*1 and 10 for CYP2D6*10/*10).
Four subjects (1 for CYP2D6*1/*1 and 3 for CYP2D6*10/*10) did not complete the study because of adverse events.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and its pharmacodynamic effects measured for QTc prolongation and neurologic side effects were evaluated after a single dose of 5 mg <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> following a pretreatment of placebo or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> at 200 mg/d for 10 days in a randomized crossover manner.
The subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 genotype showed 81% higher AUC compared to that of subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype (27.6 +/- 22.2 vs 50.2 +/- 47.1 ng h/mL).
In the subjects with both CYP2D6*10 genotype and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment, however, the oral clearance was significantly decreased to 42% of subjects with wild genotype in the placebo pretreatment (4.7 +/- 3.6 vs 2.0 +/- 1.9 L/h/kg; P < 0.05).
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) of subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 in the presence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment was significantly higher than that of subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype in the period of placebo pretreatment.
Except for this, all other pharmacodynamic estimations did not reach to statistical significance although each CYP2D6*10 genotype and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment caused higher value of UKU side effect and BARS scores.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment increased the mean area under the time-concentration curves (AUCs) of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> by 55% compared to placebo pretreatment (21.7 +/- 11.3 vs 33.5 +/- 29.3 ng h/mL).
In the presence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 showed 3-fold higher AUC of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> compared to that of placebo pretreated subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype (21.7 +/- 11.3 vs 66.7 +/- 62.1 ng h/mL; P < 0.05).
The CYP2D6*10 genotype and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment decreased the oral clearance of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> by 24% and 25%, respectively, but without a statistical significance.
The moderate effect of CYP2D6*10 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> seems to be augmented by the presence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> pretreatment.
Different effects of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> pharmacokinetics in relation to CYP2C19 genotype status.
 <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> is known to be a substrate of CYP2C19.
Our objective was to evaluate the possible effect of an inhibitor of CYP2C19, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , and compare the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> between CYP2C19 genotypes.
A two-way randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed.
Twenty-one volunteers, of whom seven were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), eight were heterozygous EMs and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, received two 6-day courses of either <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> 50 mg or placebo daily in a randomized fashion with a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> 20 mg on day 6 in all cases.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and its metabolite <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether were monitored up to 24 h after dosing.
During placebo administration, the mean AUCs(0,infinity) of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> in homozygous EMs, heterozygous EMs and PMs were 882 (95% CI, 602, 1162) ng ml-1h , 1214 (975, 1453) ng ml-1 h and 2762 (2482, 3042) ng ml-1 h (P<0.001), respectively.
There was a significant difference in <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> -mediated percentage increase in AUC(0,infinity) of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether between CYP2C19 genotypes.
It is predominantly involved in <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether metabolism in EMs.
Therefore, CYP2C19 is the key determinant of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> disposition in EMs.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment increased AUC(0,infinity) of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether by 2.8-fold (P<0.001) and 5.1-fold (P<0.01) in homozygous EMs, and by 1.7-fold (P<0.01) and 2.6-fold (P<0.01) in heterozygous EMs, and significantly prolonged the elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether in homozygous EMs and in heterozygous EMs, whereas no difference in any pharmacokinetic parameters was found in PMs.
The present study indicates that there are significant drug interactions between <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> in EMs of CYP2C19.
Pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin are significantly altered by <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> -mediated CYP3A4 induction.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> co-administration on the pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin and its active metabolite, N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin and, in addition, to compare the changes in pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin with the urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol : <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> ratio.
Ruboxistaurin is a specific protein-kinase-C beta inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of diabetic microvascular complications.
This was a two-period, one-sequence study.
Sixteen healthy male subjects completed both study periods.
In period one, a single 64 mg oral dose of ruboxistaurin was administered.
In period two, 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> was administered daily for 9 days, during which another single 64 mg ruboxistaurin dose was administered on day 7.
Blood samples were collected and assayed for ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin.
CYP3A4 induction was assessed by ratios of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol : <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> (6beta-OHC : C) obtained via 24 h and morning-spot sampling techniques.
For the metabolite, the mean C(max) decreased by 68% (P < or = 0.001), and AUC(0,infinity) decreased by 77% (P < or = 0.001).
The t(max) values did not appear affected.
The 6beta-OHC : C ratios from both 24 h and morning spot methods increased significantly, consistent with CYP3A4 induction.
In this study, 6beta OHC : C ratios substantially underestimated the impact of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on ruboxistaurin.
Results Following repeated doses of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , both the mean C(max) and AUC(0,infinity) of ruboxistaurin were significantly reduced by approximately 95% (P < or = 0.001).
The effect of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> co-administration on the exposure of ruboxistaurin is consistent with ruboxistaurin being a substrate of CYP3A4.
Therefore, co-administration with known CYP3A4 inducing agents ( <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , etc.) may decrease the concentrations of ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl-ruboxistaurin.
Effect of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> in healthy controls and in patients with Parkinson's disease.
 <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and is often co-administered with <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> in usual clinical practice.
We studied the effect of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> co-administration on the blood concentration of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> in healthy male volunteers and in PD patients.
Study 1: Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled and were randomized to take a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> (1 mg/day) for 6 days or a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> plus <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> (400 mg/day) for 6 days.
Study 2: Seven PD patients receiving stable <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> doses were enrolled.
They were evaluated for the plasma <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> concentration before and after the addition of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> 400 mg/day for 6 days, and again 1 month after discontinuation of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> .
The dose and duration of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> were decided according to usual clinical practice.
In healthy male volunteers, mean Cmax and AUC(0-10 h) of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> increased to a similar degree during co-administration of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> .
Mean plasma <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> concentration over 10 h post-dosing increased 2.6-fold with <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> co-administration.
In PD patients, plasma <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> concentration increased 1.7-fold during <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> co-administration.
Co-administration with <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> may increase the blood concentration of <START:DRUG> cabergoline <END> in healthy volunteers and in PD patients.
Effect of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
The effect of enzyme induction on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> , a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug that is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8, is not known.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> is a potent inducer of several CYP enzymes and our objective was to study its effects on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> in humans.
In a randomized, two-phase crossover study, ten healthy subjects ingested either 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> or placebo once daily for 6 days.
On the last day, they received a single oral dose of 30 mg <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
The plasma concentrations and cumulative excretion of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and its active metabolites M-IV and M-III into urine were measured up to 48 h.
"
No significant effect on peak concentration (C(max)) or time to peak (t(max)) was observed.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> increased the apparent formation rate of M-IV and shortened its t(max) (P < 0.01).
It also decreased the AUC(0-infinity) of M-IV (by 34%; P = 0.0055) and M-III (by 39%; P = 0.0026), shortened their t1/2 (M-IV by 50%; P = 0.0008, and M-III by 55%; P = 0.0016) and increased the AUC(0-infinity) ratios of M-IV and M-III to <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> by 44% (P = 0.0011) and 32% (P = 0.0027), respectively.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> increased the M-IV/ <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and M-III/ <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> ratios in urine by 98% (P = 0.0015) and 95% (P = 0.0024).
A previously unrecognized metabolite M-XI, tentatively identified as a dihydroxy metabolite, was detected in urine during both phases, and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> increased the ratio of M-XI to <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> by 240% (P = 0.0020).
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> decreased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> by 54% (range 20-66%; P = 0.0007; 95% confidence interval -78 to -30%) and shortened its dominant elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 4.9 to 2.3 h (P = 0.0002).
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> caused a substantial decrease in the plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> , probably by induction of CYP2C8.
Concomitant use of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> with <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> may decrease the efficacy of the latter drug.
Effects of cytochrome P450 3A modulators <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> on <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> pharmacokinetics.
To explore the potential for drug interactions on <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> pharmacokinetics using in vitro and in vivo assessments.
The CYP enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> metabolite formation were assessed using recombinant expressed CYPs and CYP-selective inhibitors.
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transport was tested in MDCK cells expressing the human MDR1 gene.
The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition were evaluated clinically in 12 healthy volunteers that received 25 mg <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> before and after 4 days of treatment with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 200 mg daily.
To assess CYP3A4 induction in vivo, 18 patients with psychiatric disorders were titrated to steady-state <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> levels (300 mg twice daily), then titrated to 600 mg daily <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> for 2 weeks.
CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for formation of <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> sulfoxide and N- and O-desalkylquetiapine and not a Pgp substrate.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> .
In the clinical studies, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased mean <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> plasma C(max) by 3.35-fold, from 45 to 150 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 2.51, 4.47) and decreased its clearance (CL/F) by 84%, from 138 to 22 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 0.13, 0.20).
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> decreased <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> plasma C(max) by 80%, from 1042 to 205 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 0.14, 0.28) and increased its clearance 7.5-fold, from 65 to 483 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 6.04, 9.28).
 <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> pharmacokinetics were affected by concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> , and therefore other drugs and ingested natural products that strongly modulate the activity or expression of CYP3A4 would be predicted to change exposure to <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> .
Effect of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (100 mg twice daily) on the activity of cytochrome P450 2D6 in healthy volunteers.
In the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, the protease inhibitor <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> is used in a low dose (100 mg twice daily) to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and thereby increase plasma concentrations of coadministered protease inhibitors.
When applied in a therapeutic dose (600 mg twice daily), <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> also inhibits CYP2D6.
The effect of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on CYP2D6 is unknown and was investigated in this study.
This was a 1-arm, 2-period, fixed-order study in 13 healthy male volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.
The first period examined baseline CYP2D6 activity by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> and by metabolic phenotyping with <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> .
During the second period, participants took <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , 100 mg twice daily, for 2 weeks, followed by repeat assessment of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> pharmacokinetics and the <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> metabolic phenotype in the presence of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
This effect was not apparent with the <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> /dextrorphan metabolic ratio as an indicator for CYP2D6 activity.
It is expected that the effect of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on CYP2D6 will not require standard dose reductions for CYP2D6 substrates.
Low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (100 mg twice daily) significantly increased the exposure to single-dose <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , as reflected in a geometric mean ratio (with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> /without <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> ) of 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.40) for the <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity (P < .001).
Coadministration of low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> did not significantly affect the <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> /dextrorphan urinary metabolic ratio and did not convert any extensive metabolizer to a poor metabolizer.
Low-dose <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (100 mg twice daily) exerts a modest inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2D6 in extensive metabolizers, as assessed with <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> as the index substrate.
Effect of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
Our objective was to study the effects of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and the active compounds, which are all the substrates of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.
In a randomized, two-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers were pretreated for 2 days with either 600 mg oral <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or placebo twice daily.
On day 3, they received a single dose of 600 mg <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or placebo, and 1 h later they received a single oral dose of 30 mg <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and both active metabolites M-III and M-IV were measured for up to 120 h.
"
No statistically significant changes were seen in the total AUC of M-III or M-IV after <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> pretreatment.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> reduced the M-III/ <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and M-IV/ <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> AUC(0-infinity) ratio by 71% (P<0.001) and 65%(P<0.001), strikingly prolonging their t((1/2)).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raised the mean total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of parent <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> 3.4-fold (P<0.001).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> greatly increased the plasma concentration of parent <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and also inhibited the further metabolism of M-III and M-IV.
Careful blood glucose monitoring and dosage adjustments are suggested during coadministration of <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> affects <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> kinetics and dynamics.
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> used as oral drug treatment for erectile dysfunction is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4.
The antidepressant <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> dosed to steady state on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
Twelve healthy men received oral <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> or placebo for 10 days (50 mg every day on days 1-3; 100 mg every day on days 4-10).
On day 11, all participants received a single, oral, open-label dose of 50 mg <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> , and blood samples were collected for analysis of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> plasma concentrations by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Concurrently, the effect of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on venodilation induced by a constant dose of sodium <START:DRUG> nitroprusside <END> was assessed using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique.
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> was well tolerated in the presence of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
Concurrently, sodium <START:DRUG> nitroprusside <END> -induced venodilation was significantly augmented by 59% during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> compared to placebo (P = 0.012).
Whereas the pharmacokinetic changes do not suggest a large clinically relevant interaction, it may be prudent to consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients concurrently treated with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
During <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> exposure (area under the curve) significantly increased by 40% (P < 0.001), and its half-life increased by 19% (P = 0.034).
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> kinetics are mildly affected by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> which translates into an increase in vascular <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> effects.
Interaction magnitude, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> in relation to CYP2C19 genotypic status.
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the extent of the interaction and on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> .
Homozygous (hmEMs) and heterozygous extensive metabolizers (htEMs), and poor metabolizers (PMs, n = 6 each) took an oral dose (20 mg) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
After a 1-week washout period, each subject received <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> (200 mg) for 8 days, and <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 7.
On day 8, <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> was given again and its kinetic disposition was compared with that in the first dose.
ADP-induced platelet aggregation was measured as a pharmacodynamic index.
No significant intergenotypic differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> were observed, although the accumulation ratio tended to be greater in hmEMs than in PMs (2.4 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.2).
A significantly positive correlation (P = 0.031) was observed between the individual percent inhibition of platelet aggregation and AUC0-24 of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> regardless of the CYP2C19 polymorphism.
 <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> is a potent inhibitor for CYP2C19 and may be associated with the phenocopy when CYPC19 substrates are co-administered to EMs.
Whether and to what extent CYP2C19 would be involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> remain unanswered from the present in-vivo study.
In contrast to the PMs, whose mean kinetic parameters were not altered by the repeated dosings of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> , an eight- to 10-fold increase in the mean AUC ratio of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> to 5-hydroxyomeprazole was observed in both the EM groups.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> impairs single-dose <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> clearance without altering <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> pharmacodynamics.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> impairs the clearance of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> and prolongs its elimination half-life, which is attributable to inhibition of CYP1A2 by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
The clinical importance of this interaction is not established.
To evaluate the effects of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the kinetics and dynamics of single doses of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> .
Seven healthy subjects received single 250 mg doses of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (or matching placebo) together with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (four doses of 100 mg over 2 days) or with matching placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study.
For 24 h after <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> or placebo administration, plasma <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> concentrations were determined.
Psychomotor performance, sedation, and electroencephalographic (EEG) \"beta\" frequency activity were also assessed.
 <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> produced CNS-stimulating effects compared with placebo.
However, psychomotor performance, alertness, or EEG effects attributable to <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> were not augmented by coadministration of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
However, this study does not rule out possible adverse effects due to extensive accumulation of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> with daily ingestion in <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> -treated individuals.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> significantly reduced apparent oral clearance of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (105 vs. 9.1 mL min(-1), P < 0.01; mean difference: 95.7 mL min(-1), 95% CI: 54.9-135.6), and prolonged its elimination half-life (4.9 vs. 56 h, P < 0.01; mean difference: 51 h, 95% CI: 26-76).
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> greatly impaired <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> clearance, but without detectable changes in <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> pharmacodynamics.
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> .
 <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> (IRESSA, ZD1839), an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved in several countries for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
Preclinical studies were conducted to determine the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> and to evaluate the potential of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> to cause drug interactions through inhibition of CYP isoenzymes.
Based on these findings, three clinical studies were carried out to investigate pharmacokinetic drug interactions in vivo with <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> .
In preclinical studies radiolabelled <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> was incubated with: (i) hepatic microsomal protein in the presence of selective CYP inhibitors; and (ii) expressed CYP enzymes.
Human hepatic microsomal protein was incubated with selective CYP substrates in the presence of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> .
Clinical studies were all phase I, open-label, single-centre studies; two had a randomised, two-way crossover design and the third was nonrandomised.
The first and second studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> in the presence of a potent CYP3A4 inducer ( <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> [ <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ]) or inhibitor ( <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> ) in healthy male volunteers.
The third study investigated the effects that <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> had on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> , a CYP2D6 substrate, in patients with solid tumours.
The results of preclinical studies demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> and that <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity.
There was no apparent change in the safety profile of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> as a result of coadministration with other agents.
Although CYP3A4 inducers may reduce exposure to <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> , further work is required to define any resultant effect on the efficacy of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> .
Exposure to <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> is increased by coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors, but since <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> is known to have a good tolerability profile, a dosage reduction is not recommended.
 <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> is unlikely to exert a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism for their clearance, but the potential to increase plasma concentrations should be considered if <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> is coadministered with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index or are individually dose titrated.
In clinical studies when <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> was administered in the presence of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> , geometric mean (gmean) maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were reduced by 65% and 83%, respectively; these changes were statistically significant.
When <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> was administered in the presence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , gmean AUC increased by 78% and 61% at <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> doses of 250 and 500 mg, respectively; these changes also being statistically significant.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> with <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> resulted in a 35% increase in the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> area under plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration; this change was not statistically significant.
Clinical pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> , the first ketolide antibacterial.
 <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> is the first ketolide, which is a new class of antibacterial agents related to the macrolides that have structural modifications permitting dual binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA so that activity is retained against Streptococcus pneumoniae with macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin(B) resistance.
Clinical experience in infectious patients has shown that oral <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> 800mg once daily for 5-10 days is effective for the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
Absorption of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> in humans is estimated to be > or = 90%.
Prior to entering the systemic circulation, <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> undergoes first-pass metabolism (mainly by the liver).
Its absolute bioavailability is 57% and is unaffected by food.
The volume of distribution of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> after intravenous infusion is 2.9 L/kg.
 <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> is 60-70% bound to serum proteins and has extensive diffusion into a range of target biological tissues, achieving concentrations above its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against key respiratory pathogens throughout the dosing interval.
After entering the systemic circulation, <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> is eliminated by multiple pathways (7% by biliary and/or intestinal excretion, 13% by renal excretion and 37% by hepatic metabolism).
 <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> is metabolised via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and non-CYP pathways.
The identified metabolites show minimal antibacterial activity compared with the parent drug.
In healthy subjects receiving <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> 800 mg once daily, the peak plasma concentration achieved is 2.27 microg/mL.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> show a biphasic decrease over time, with an initial disposition half-life of 2.9 hours and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 10 hours after multiple dose administration.
Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 2-3 days of once-daily administration.
Owing to elimination by multiple pathways there is a small increase in exposure when one of these elimination pathways is impaired, as indicated by the results of studies in special patient populations (e.g. those with hepatic or renal impairment).
Dosage reductions may be recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.
The potential for <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> to inhibit the CYP3A4 pathway is similar to that of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> .
The once-daily administration of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> is likely to limit the potential for drug interactions and clinically significant increases in exposure.
In phase III clinical trials, the <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> 800 mg once-daily dose has been shown to provide close to the maximum antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> has a well characterised and reproducible pharmacokinetic profile, with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships supporting an oral dosage regimen of 800 mg once daily.
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by potent inhibitors such as <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> results in a 54% and 95% increase in <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve, respectively.
Interaction between <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are often prescribed in association with antihypertensive agents, including calcium antagonists.
 <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
The calcium antagonist <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> is also metabolized by CYP3A4.
The purpose of this study was to investigate drug interactions between <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
Eight patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were enrolled.
They were given 4 weeks of oral <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> (5 mg/day), followed by 4 weeks of oral <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> (5 mg/day) co-administered with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> (5 mg/day).
This study is the first to determine prospectively the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
Combined treatment with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> increased the peak concentration (C(max)) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors from 9.6 +/- 3.7 ng/ml to 13.7 +/- 4.7 ng/ml (p < 0.05) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 34.3 +/- 16.5 ng h/ml to 43.9 +/- 16.6 ng h/ml (p < 0.05) without affecting the <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> -lowering effect of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> markedly decreases and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> increases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and its metabolites.
The pharmacokinetic interactions of the widely used statin <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> with fibrates and enzyme inducers are not known.
Therefore we studied the effects of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
Two randomized crossover studies were conducted.
In study 1, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or placebo once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, they ingested a single 40-mg dose of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
In study 2, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or placebo twice daily for 5 days.
On day 3, they ingested a single 20-mg dose of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (in nanograms per milliliter) and its metabolites (in arbitrary units) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry up to 48 to 72 hours after dosing.
It is advisable to increase the dosage of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and preferable to administer it in the evening to guarantee adequate concentrations during the nighttime rapid <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> synthesis when <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or other potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 are coadministered.
Care is warranted, and only low doses of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> should be used if coadministration with <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> is needed.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of unchanged <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (acid) by 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73% to 84%; P < .001), that of the active metabolites 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 43% (95% CI, 29% to 51%; P < .001) and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 81% (95% CI, 74% to 84%; P < .001), and that of their lactones by 93% (95% CI, 90% to 95%), by 61% (95% CI, 50% to 69%), and by 76% (95% CI, 70% to 81%), respectively (P < .001).
The peak plasma concentration of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid was increased by 68% (95% CI, 21% to 127%; P = .005) by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> shortened (P < .001) the half-lives of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (by 74%; 95% CI, 67% to 81%) and its metabolites, for example, <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> lactone (by 82%; 95% CI, 80% to 85%) and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 70%; 95% CI, 64% to 78%).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> increased the AUC of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (by 24%; 95% CI, -1% to 50%; P =.059), 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 51%; 95% CI, 28% to 70%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 29%; 95% CI, 13% to 53%; P =.003), and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 82%; 95% CI, 60% to 126%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 28%; 95% CI, 15% to 51%; P =.001).
The half-lives of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and its lactone metabolites were slightly shortened by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (P < .05).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> markedly decreases and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> moderatelyincreases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and its metabolites.
Effect of <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> (CBZ) undergoes biotransformation by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, and glucuronide conjugation.
There has been no clear demonstration to reveal the role of glucuronidation in the disposition of CBZ.
We evaluated the effect of <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> , a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of CBZ in humans.
In a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study, ten healthy male subjects were treated twice daily for 10 days with 500 mg <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> or with a matched placebo.
On day 6, a single dose of 200 mg CBZ was administered orally.
Concentrations of CBZ and CBZ 10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) in plasma and urine were measured.
However, <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> had minimal effect on the recovery of the conjugated and free forms of CBZ and CBZ-E in urine.
Although <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> showed a minimal effect on the glucuronidation of CBZ and CBZ-E, it increased CBZ biotransformation to CBZ-E, most likely reflecting the induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 activities, in humans.
 <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of CBZ from 1253.9 micromol h/l to 1020.7 micromol h/l (P < 0.001) while increasing that of CBZ-E from 137.6 micromol h/l to 183.5 micromol h/l (P = 0.033).
The oral clearance of CBZ was increased by <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> by 26% (90% confidence interval, 17-34%; P < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> increased the AUC ratio of CBZ-E/CBZ from 0.11 to 0.16 (P < 0.001).
These results demonstrate that glucuronide conjugation plays a minor role in the metabolism of CBZ and CBZ-E in humans, and that <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> has an inducing effect on the disposition of CBZ.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increases plasma concentrations of antimalarial <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> in healthy human volunteers.
Antimalarial <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> has a structure related to <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
The major metabolite of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> is 3-hydroxyquinine formed by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, is known to markedly increase plasma concentrations of various co-administered drugs including <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
To assess the effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> in healthy Thai male volunteers.
In an open, randomized two-phase crossover study separated by a 1-month period, eight healthy Thai male volunteers received a single oral dose of 500 mg <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> alone or co-administration with 400 mg/day <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> orally for 10 days.
Serial blood samples were collected at specific time points for a 56-day period.
Plasma <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> and <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> carboxylic metabolite concentrations during 56 days were measured by a modified and validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection.
In case of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> is co-administered with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , drug-drug interactions should be recognized and the dose of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> should be adjusted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy and to reduce the cost of therapy.
Co-administration with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> markedly increased the mean values of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> AUC0-t, t(1/2), and Cmax when compared with <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> alone by 79% (P < 0.001), 39% (P < 0.05) and 64% (P < 0.001) respectively.
The AUC0-t , and Cmax of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> carboxylic acid metabolite were decreased by 28% (P < 0.05) and 31% (P < 0.05), respectively when compared with <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> alone.
Co-administration with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased plasma <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> concentrations in healthy human volunteers.
One of possible mechanisms of the increase in plasma <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> concentrations may be the result of the inhibition of CYP3A4 by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
The effect of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4) have a minor effect on <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> pharmacokinetics.
We studied the effect of coadministration of the antidepressant <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (CYP1A2 inhibitor) and antimicrobial drug <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (CYP3A4 inhibitor) on <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> pharmacokinetics in a double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover study.
Nine volunteers ingested daily 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and placebo, 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and 1500 mg <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , or their corresponding placebos for 5 days.
On day 6, 1.5 mg/kg <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> was administered IV over 60 min.
Concentrations of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> and its major metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide were measured for 10 h.
During the combination phase the half-life of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> (4.3 h) was longer than during the placebo (2.6 h; P < 0.001) or <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (3.5 h; P < 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> alone decreased the clearance of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> by 41% (P < 0.001) and prolonged its elimination half-life from .6 to 3.5 h (P < 0.01)2.
During the combination of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> clearance was 53% smaller than during placebo (P < 0.001) and 21% smaller than during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> alone (P < 0.05).
We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> considerably reduces elimination of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> and may increase the risk of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> toxicity.
Concomitant use of both <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> can further increase plasma <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> concentrations by decreasing its clearance.
Effect of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> in healthy subjects.
Case reports suggest that gemfobrozil can increase the anticoagulant effect of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
Because <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> inhibits CYP2C9 in vitro, we studied its effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
In a randomized cross-over study, 10 healthy subjects ingested 600 mg <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or placebo twice daily for 8 days.
On day 3, they were administered a single dose of 10 mg racemic R-S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> orally.
The concentrations of R- and S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> in plasma and thromboplastin time were monitored up to 168 h.
"
There were no significant differences in the elimination half-lives of S- or R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> between the phases.
Displacement of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> from plasma albumin by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> or its interference with the absorption of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> could explain the present findings.
Usual therapeutic doses of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> seem to have limited effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> decreased the mean (+/-SD) area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC((0-infinity))] of S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> by 11%, from 19.9 +/- 5.2 mg l(-1) h to 17.6 +/- 4.7 mg l(-1) h (95% CI on the difference -3.7, -0.78; P < 0.01) and that of R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> by 6% from 31.3 +/- 7.5 mg l(-1) h during the <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> phase to 29.5 +/- 6.9 mg l(-1) h during the placebo phase (95% CI -3.3, -0.33; P < 0.05).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> did not alter the anticoagulant effect of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
Unexpectedly, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> slightly decreased the plasma concentrations of R- and S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
Influence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> co-administration and CYP2D6 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the new antipsychotic ARIPIPRAZOLE.
The results of in vitro studies indicated that ARIPIPRAZOLE, a newly developed antipsychotic, is mainly metabolized by the human cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.
The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (hereafter referred to as ITZ) co-administration (CYP3A4 inhibition) on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE administered to 24 healthy adult male volunteers in a fasting condition.
The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition was also examined by CYP2D6 genotype.
All subjects were administered a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE alone in Period I and a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE following administration of ITZ at 100 mg/day for 7 consecutive days in Period II.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ARIPIPRAZOLE and its main metabolite OPC-14857 were determined.
For the co-administration period, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in intermediate metabolizers was about half of that in extensive metabolizers.
For Cmax, there was no significant difference between extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers, and the percent change by co-administration of ITZ was less than 20% in both extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers.
For OPC-14857, the t(max) in intermediate metabolizers was longer than that in extensive metabolizers, with the difference being amplified by co-administration of ITZ.
The AUC336 hr showed similar increases by co-administration of ITZ in all genotypes.
The urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentration ratio following ITZ administration for 7 consecutive days was about half of that before the start of ITZ administration, indicating that CYP3A4 metabolic activity was inhibited by administration of ITZ.
The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE was not considered to be clinically significant.
On the other hand, definite differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between CYP2D6 genotypes.
Co-administration of ITZ increased the Cmax, AUC336 hr, and t1/2,z of ARIPIPRAZOLE and OPC-14857 by 19.4%, 48.0%, and 18.6% and by 18.6%, 38.8%, and 53.4%, respectively.
By co-administration of ITZ, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in extensive metabolizers was decreased by 26.6%, with an even greater decrease (47.3%,.) in intermediate metabolizers.
Effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> .
To determine whether coadministration of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> will modify the pharmacokinetic profile of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> , and to assess the safety of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> .
Two single-center, open-label studies; the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> study was nonrandomized, sequential, and multiple dose, and the <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> study was randomized, two-period crossover, and single dose.
Two clinical investigative centers in the United States.
Thirty-four healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 18-45 years.
All patients received <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> 800 mg/day; 18 patients received concomitant <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> 200 mg/day, and 16 received concomitant single-dose, single-strength <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> .
Standard pharmacokinetic and safety measurements were performed.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> given concomitantly with <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> increased the steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> by 53.8% (p<0.0001).
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> did not affect <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> pharmacokinetic parameters, and <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> was well tolerated in both studies.
Only modest changes in the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> were seen with concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> telithromycin <END> pharmacokinetics were unaffected by concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> .
The effect of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on CYP2C8 mediated <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> metabolism in human liver microsomes and healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> , a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic medication used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP2C8.
The anti-infective drug <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> has been shown in vitro to be a selective inhibitor of CYP2C8.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on the CYP2C8 mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in vivo and in vitro.
The effect of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in vitro was assessed in pooled human liver microsomes.
The effect in vivo was determined by evaluating <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> pharmacokinetics in the presence and absence of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> .
Eight healthy subjects (four men and four women) completed a randomized, cross-over study.
Subjects received single dose <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> (8 mg) in the presence and absence of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> 200 mg given twice daily for 5 days.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> reduced the para-O-sulphate <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> / <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> and the N-desmethylrosiglitazone/ <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> AUC(0-24) ratios by 22% and 38%, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> inhibited <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> metabolism both in vitro and in vivo.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> para-hydroxylation by <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> in vitro was found to be competitive with apparent K(i) and IC(50) values of 29 microm and 54.5 microm, respectively.
In the presence of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> , <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> plasma AUC was increased by 31% (P = 0.01) from 2774 +/- 645 microg l(-1) h to 3643 +/- 1051 microg l(-1) h (95% confidence interval (CI) for difference 189, 1549), and half-life was increased by 27% (P = 0.006) from 3.3 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.8 h (95% CI for difference 0.36, 1.5).
These results indicate that <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> metabolism in vitro and that <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> administration increases plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentrations in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> greatly increases concentrations and hypotensive effect of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 1A2-mediated presystemic metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> , a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and has a low oral bioavailability.
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> is only a moderately potent inhibitor of CYP1A2.
Our objective was to study the extent and mechanism of a possible interaction of <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> with <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
In a double-blind, randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers ingested 500 mg <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> or placebo twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, a single dose of 4 mg <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> was ingested 1 hour after the morning dose of <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> and pharmacodynamic variables were measured.
A <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> test was used as a marker for CYP1A2 activity.
The AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and its change correlated (P < .01) with the <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> /paraxanthine ratio and its change.
 <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> seems to be a useful probe drug for measuring presystemic metabolism by CYP1A2.
Care should be exercised when <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> is used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> by 10-fold (range, 6-fold to 24-fold; P < .001)and its peak concentration by 7-fold (range, 4-fold to 21-fold; P < .001), whereas its elimination half-life was only prolonged from 1.5 to 1.8 hours (P = .007).
The pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> were much stronger during the <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> phase than during the placebo phase with regard to changes in systolic blood pressure (-35 mm Hg versus -15 mm Hg, P = .001), diastolic blood pressure (-24 mm Hg versus -11 mm Hg, P < .001), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P = .02), subjective drug effect (P = .002), and subjective drowsiness (P = .009).
 <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> greatly elevates plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and dangerously potentiates its hypotensive and sedative effects, mainly by inhibiting its CYP1A2-mediated metabolism, at least when administered 1 hour before <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , and <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> when coadministered with cytochrome P450 inhibitors.
Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia.
Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure.
Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , and <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> .
Compared with <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> alone, coadministration of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> was associated with no significant changes in <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> pharmacokinetics.
However, concomitant <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> increased the <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001).
Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60%increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> were observed when coadministered with <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> .
The half-life of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC).
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> ( approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid (12-fold), followed by <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> (greater than fourfold) and then <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (almost twofold).
Effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in healthy subjects.
Fungal infection is a significant comorbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus, and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , an antifungal agent, causes a number of drug interactions with coadministered drugs.
 <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> is a novel thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9.
We investigated the possible effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in humans.
Ten healthy Korean male volunteers were treated twice daily for 5 days with 200 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or with placebo, using a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study.
On day 5, a single dose of 8 mg <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was administered orally, and plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentrations were measured.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> by 47% [P = 0.0003; 95% confidence interval (CI) 23, 70] and the mean elimination half-life from 3.55 to 5.50 h (P = 0.0003; 95% CI in difference 1.1, 2.4).
The peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was increased by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment by 17% (P = 0.03; 95% CI 5, 29).
The apparent oral clearance of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> decreased by 28% after <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment (P = 0.0005; 95% CI 18, 38).
This study revealed that <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> affected the disposition of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in humans, probably by the inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, leading to increasing <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentrations that could increase the efficacy of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> or its adverse events.
Effects of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of the cytochrome P450 2C8 substrate <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> is a relatively selective inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme in vitro.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) is a potent inducer of several CYP enzymes, and in vitro studies have suggested that it also induces CYP2C8.
Our aims were to investigate possible effects of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on CYP2C8 activity by use of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> , a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug metabolized primarily by CYP2C8, as an in vivo probe.
Two separate randomized crossover studies with 2 phases were conducted.
In study 1, 10 healthy volunteers took 160 mg <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days.
On day 3, they ingested a single 4-mg dose of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
In study 2, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or placebo orally once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, they ingested a single 4-mg dose of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
In both studies, plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> and N -desmethylrosiglitazone concentrations were measured for up to 48 hours.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> reduced the formation of N -desmethylrosiglitazone.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> increased the formation of N -desmethylrosiglitazone.
Results In study 1, <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> raised the area under the plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentration-time curve [AUC(0- infinity )] by 37% (range, 16% to 51%; P <.0001) and the peak plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentration (C max ) by 14% (range, -3% to 38%; P =.0014).
The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was prolonged from 3.8 to 4.8 hours ( P =.0013).
In study 2, <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the AUC(0- infinity ) and C max of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> by 54% (range, 46% to 63%; P <.0001) and 28% (range, 2% to 56%; P =.0003), respectively.
The t 1/2 of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was shortened from 3.8 to 1.9 hours ( P <.0001).
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> raises and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduces the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> by inhibiting and inducing, respectively, the CYP2C8-catalyzed biotransformation of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
Effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> during inhibited and induced metabolic states.
Our objective was to investigate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the systemic clearance of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in constitutive, inhibited, and induced metabolic conditions.
Nineteen healthy volunteers were grouped with regard to the CYP3A5*3 allele, into homozygous wild-type (CYP3A5*1/*1, n = 6), heterozygous (CYP3A5*1/*3, n = 6), and homozygous variant-type (CYP3A5*3/*3, n = 7) subject groups.
The pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was characterized before and after <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> administration (200 mg once daily for 4 days) and also after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) pretreatment (600 mg once daily for 10 days), with a washout period of 2 weeks in between.
The pharmacokinetic profiles of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and of its hydroxy metabolites did not show differences between the genotype groups under basal and induced metabolic conditions.
However, during the inhibited metabolic state, the CYP3A5*3/*3 group showed a greater decrease in systemic clearance than was seen in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (8.5 +/- 3.8 L. h(-1).70 kg(-1) versus 13.5 +/- 2.7 L. h(-1).70 kg(-1), P =.027).
The 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to- <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio was also significantly lower in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group (0.58 +/- 0.35 versus 1.09 +/- 0.37 for the homozygous wild-type group, P =.026).
The CYP3A5 genotype did not affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in the basal or induced states.
However, during cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , individuals carrying the CYP3A5*1 allele were found to be less susceptible to changes in systemic clearance and showed higher 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to- <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios, probably resulting from the relatively CYP3A4-specific inhibition caused by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> on <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers with CYP2C19 mutations.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> , on <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers with mutations in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 gene (CYP2C19).
An open-label crossover study was performed with 19 healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> (2 mg) was administered orally with and without <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> (30 mg per day for 4 days) or <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> (10 mg per day for 4 days).
Blood concentrations of <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> were determined before and 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after dosing.
Genotyping for CYP2C19 was conducted by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
The percent change for <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> AUC0-8 in subjects with and without CYP2C19 mutant alleles was 81% and 29%, respectively.
These observations suggest that drug interaction between <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> and <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> occurs in subjects with higher <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> blood concentrations corresponding to CYP2C19 genetic status.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> has minimal effect on <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> pharmacokinetics regardless of CYP2C19 genotype status.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> significantly decreased the oral <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> clearance, resulting in an increase in the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC0-8) (control vs with <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> : 29.7 +/- 3.5 vs 44.1 +/- 5.0 ng h mL(-1), P < 0.05).
Large individual variation was observed in the effects of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> on <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> AUC0-8 owing to CYP2C19 genotype status.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> also increased the mean AUC0-8 of <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> , but the difference was not statistically significant.
Effects of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> on the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> .
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the main CYP isozyme involved in <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism.
We investigated the influence of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , which contains inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> .
For 5 days, 8 patients undergoing <START:DRUG> methadone <END> maintenance treatment received 200 mL water or <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> 30 minutes before and again together with their daily dose of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> .
Blood sampling for R-, S-, and R,S- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> plasma determination was performed over a 24-hour period.
CYP3A activity was determined by measuring the plasma 1'-hydroxymidazolam/ <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ratio.
A similar increase in peak level and decrease in apparent clearance were measured with <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , whereas time to peak level, terminal half-life, and apparent volume during the terminal phase of R-, S-, and R,S- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> were not affected by <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> .
No symptom of overmedication was either detected by the clinical staff or reported by the patients.
However, it cannot be excluded that a much stronger effect may occur in some patients, and thus <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> intake is not recommended during <START:DRUG> methadone <END> maintenance treatment, in particular in patients initiating such a treatment.
A decrease in the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ratio was measured in all patients after <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> (mean +/- SD before <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , 9.3 +/- 5.9; mean +/- SD after <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , 3.9 +/- 1.2; P <.05).
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> led to a mean 17% increase in the area under the curve extrapolated to 24 hours for both enantiomers of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> (range, 3% to 29% [P <.005]; range, -4% to 37% [P <.05]; and range, 1% to 32% [P <.01]; for R-, S-, and R,S- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> , respectively).
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> administration is associated with a modest increase in <START:DRUG> methadone <END> bioavailability, which is not expected to endanger patients.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> mesylate (Glivec) in healthy subjects.
The study under discussion was a drug-drug interaction study in which the effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of Glivec ( <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> ) was investigated.
A total of 14 healthy subjects (13 male, 1 female) were enrolled in this study.
Each subject received a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> 200 mg alone, and a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> 200 mg coadministered with a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 400 mg according to a two-period crossover design.
The treatment sequence was randomly allocated.
Subtherapeutic <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> doses and a short exposure were tested in order not to overexpose the healthy volunteers.
There was a minimum 7-day washout period between the two sequences.
Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations were taken up to 96 h after dosing.
 <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> and CGP74588 (main metabolite of <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> ) concentrations were measured using LC/MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a non-compartmental analysis.
Given its previously demonstrated safety profile, this increased exposure to <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> is likely to be clinically significant only at high doses.
This interaction should be considered when administering inhibitors of the CYP3A family in combination with <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> .
Following <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> coadministration, the mean <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> C(max), AUC((0-24)) and AUC((0- infinity )) increased significantly by 26% ( P<0.005), 40% ( P<0.0005) and 40% ( P <0.0005), respectively.
There was a statistically significant decrease in apparent clearance (CL/F) of <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> with a mean reduction of 28.6% ( P<0.0005).
The mean C(max) and AUC((0-24)) of the metabolite CGP74588 decreased significantly by 22.6% ( P<0.005) and 13% ( P<0.05) after <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment, although the AUC((0- infinity )) of CGP74588 only decreased by 5% ( P=0.28).
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> caused a 40% increase in exposure to <START:DRUG> imatinib <END> in healthy volunteers.
Effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
In vitro studies indicate that the anticancer drug <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> is primarily eliminated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism.
Coadministration of drugs that modulate the activity of CYP3A4 is, therefore, likely to have undesirable clinical consequences.
We investigated the effects of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> in patients with cancer.
Seven patients were treated in a randomized crossover design with <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> (100 mg/m(2)), followed 3 weeks later by <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> (10 mg/m(2)) given in combination with orally administered <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (200 mg once daily for 3 days), or the reverse sequence.
Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis.
The <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance ratio in the presence and absence of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was weakly related to the area under the curve of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (R(2) = 0.529, P =.064).
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> in vivo results in <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> clearance values that have previously been shown to be associated with a several-fold increase in the odds for febrile neutropenia at standard doses.
Caution should be taken and substantial dose reductions are required if <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> has to be administered together with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> coadministration resulted in a 49% decrease in clearance of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> (P =.018).
The mean (+/-SD) clearance values were 35.0 +/- 11.8 L/h (95% confidence interval, 24.1-45.9 L/h) for <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> alone and 18.2 L/h (95% confidence interval, 9.22-27.1 L/h) in the presence of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> drastically increases concentrations and effects of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> : a potentially hazardous interaction.
Our objective was to study the effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> , a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.
In a double-blind, randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> or placebo orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 4-mg dose of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and pharmacodynamic variables were measured.
A <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> test was performed on day 3 to examine the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> pharmacokinetics.
All pharmacodynamic variables revealed a significant difference between the <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and placebo phases, eg, in the maximal effects on systolic blood pressure (-35 mm Hg, P =.000009), diastolic blood pressure (-20 mm Hg, P =.00002), heart rate (-4 beats/min, P =.007), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P =.0003), subjective drug effect (P =.0000001), and drowsiness (P =.0002).
In particular, the decrease in systolic blood pressure, to the level of 80 mm Hg or even less, was an alarming finding.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> -metabolizing enzyme(s), mainly CYP1A2, by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> seems to explain the observed interaction.
Because of the potentially hazardous consequences, the concomitant use of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , or other potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, should be avoided.
On average, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> increased the total area under the concentration-time curve [AUC(0- infinity )] of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> 33-fold (range, 14-fold to 103-fold; P =.000002) and the peak plasma concentration 12-fold (range, 5-fold to 32-fold; P =.000001).
The mean elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> was prolonged from 1.5 to 4.3 hours (P =.00004) by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
The AUC(0- infinity ) of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and its increase by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> correlated with the <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> /paraxanthine ratio and its increase, respectively (P <.03).
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> seriously affects the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and increases the intensity and duration of its effects.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> seems to act as both an inducer and an inhibitor of the metabolism of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
To investigate if <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> is both an inducer and an inhibitor of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism, it was determined whether the timing of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> co-administration influences the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Male volunteers ( n=12) participated in a randomised, two-period, crossover trial evaluating the effect of multiple doses of 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> once daily for 7 days on <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism.
Subjects were, after baseline measurements of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> pharmacokinetics, randomised to receive, on either day 7 or day 8 of the <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> administration period, a single dose of 4 mg <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> and vice versa in the following period.
Neither the peak plasma concentration (C(max)), time to reach C(max) (t(max)) nor terminal half-life (t(1/2)) was statistically significantly affected.
The median C(max) was now statistically significantly reduced from 35 ng/ml to 7.5 ng/ml.
Neither t(max) nor t(1/2) was significantly affected.
After discontinuing <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> administration, while the inductive effect on CYP3A4 and probably also CYP2C8 is still present, an even more marked reduction in the plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> was observed.
Our results suggest that concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> may cause a clinically relevant decrease in the glucose-lowering effect of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> , in particular when <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> treatment is discontinued or if the drugs are not administered simultaneously or within a few hours of each other.
When <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> was given, together with the last <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> dose, on day 7, an almost 50% reduction of the median <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was observed.
When <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> was given on day 8, 24 h after the last <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> dose, an almost 80% reduction of the median <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> AUC was observed.
When <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> are administered concomitantly, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> seems to act as both an inducer and an inhibitor of the metabolism of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Different inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> metabolism between CYP2C19 genotypes.
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> is mainly metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19.
The inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , an inhibitor of CYP2C19 as well as CYP1A2, on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> was compared between different genotypes for CYP2C19.
Eighteen volunteers, of whom six were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), six were heterozygous EMs and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study.
A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed.
All subjects received two six-day courses of either daily 50 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> or placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral 40 mg dose of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> on day six in both cases.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphone, and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> were monitored up to 8 h after the dosing.
During placebo administration, geometric means of peak concentration (C(max)), under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h (AUC(0,8 h)) and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> were 900 ng ml(-1), 1481 ng ml(-1) h, and 0.6 h in homozygous EMs, 1648 ng ml(-1), 4225 ng ml(-1) h, and 1.1 h in heterozygous EMs, and 2991 ng ml(-1), 11537 ng ml(-1) h, and 2.8 h in PMs, respectively.
However, no pharmacokinetic parameters were changed in PMs.
Even a low dose of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> increased <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> exposure in EMs, but did not increase <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> exposure in PMs after a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
These findings confirm a potent inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on CYP2C19 activity.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment increased C(max) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> by 3.7-fold (95%CI, 2.4, 5.0-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.0-fold (1.4, 2.6-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0,8 h) by 6.0-fold (3.3, 8.7-fold, P < 0.001) and 2.4-fold (1.7, 3.2-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0, infinity ) by 6.2-fold (3.0, 9.3-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.5-fold (1.6, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and prolonged t((1/2)) by 2.6-fold (1.9, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and 1.4-fold (1.02, 1.7-fold, P < 0.05), respectively.
The AUC(0,8 h) ratios of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> were decreased with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> in homozygous EMs (P < 0.05) and heterozygous EMs (P < 0.01).
The bioavailability of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> might, to some extent, be increased through inhibition of P-glycoprotein during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment.
The CYP2C8 inhibitor <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> increases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in healthy subjects.
Our aim was to investigate the effect of the CYP2C8 inhibitor <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antidiabetic drug <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> , and to examine the influence of the former on the metabolism of the latter in vitro.
In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with two phases, nine healthy volunteers took 160 mg <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, 1 h after the last dose of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> or placebo, they ingested a single 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Plasma <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> and blood glucose concentrations were measured for up to 7 h post-dose.
In addition, the effect of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> by human liver microsomes was investigated.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of its aromatic amine metabolite (M1), but decreased the M1 : <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> AUC(0, infinity ) ratio by 38% (P = 0.0005).
In vitro, <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> inhibited the metabolism of (220 nm) <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in a concentration-dependent manner.
Although the interaction did not significantly enhance the effect of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> on blood glucose concentration at the drug doses used, the possibility of an increased risk of hypoglycaemia should be considered during concomitant use of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in patients with diabetes.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> raised the AUC(0, infinity ) and C(max) of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> by 61% (range, 30-117%; P= 0.0008) and 41% (P = 0.005.), respectively, and prolonged the t((1/2)) of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> from 0.9 to 1.1 h (P = 0.001).
No effect of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> on the blood glucose-lowering effect of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> was detectable.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> raised the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> probably by inhibiting its CYP2C8-mediated biotransformation.
Effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) causes several drug interactions with coadministered antidiabetic drugs.
 <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> is a novel thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, but little is known about the drug interaction between <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
Our objective was to investigate the effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in humans.
In an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study, 10 healthy Korean male subjects were treated once daily for 6 days with 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or with placebo.
On day 7, a single dose of 8 mg <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was administered orally.
Plasma <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> concentrations were measured.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> by 65% (2947.9 ng.h/mL versus 991.5 ng.h/mL, P <.001) and the mean elimination half-life from 3.9 to 1.5 hours (P <.001).
The peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> was significantly decreased by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (537.7 ng/mL versus 362.3 ng/mL, P <.01).
The apparent oral clearance of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> increased about 3-fold after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment (2.8 L/h versus 8.5 L/h, P <.001).
This study showed that <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> affected the disposition of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in humans, probably by the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9.
Therefore caution should be exercised during the coadministration of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
Pharmacokinetic interactions between <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> / <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> in health volunteers.
The association <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> / <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> is of current wide use in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori associated gastroduodenal ulcer.
This combination may result in increased levels of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> with potential interactions with commonly associated drugs.
Kinetic/metabolic changes occurring after <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> / <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> were compared to those occurring after <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> / <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> in healthy volunteers.
Eight healthy volunteers, all males, age 25-34 years, all EM for CYP2C19, participated in a randomized, double blind crossover study in two periods of 7 days, separated by a 14-day washout.
In each treatment period, subjects took either <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 20mg b.i.d.
together with <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> 500 mg b.i.d., or <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> 40 mg b.i.d.
with the same dose of the antibiotic.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> were compared to those after intake of both agents alone.
Kinetics of unchanged <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> was evaluated at the end of the two periods.
Kinetics of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> did not differ after the two associated treatments.
The administration of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> with two different proton pump inhibitors indicates that the antibiotic can markedly increase <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , not <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> , levels.
This observation may result in a better therapeutic response to <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , but it may also potentially affect either the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates or interfere with the absorption of drugs requiring an intact gastric digestion system.
The mean value of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of unchanged <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> increased almost two-fold after concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> ; the average 5-OH- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> AUC was instead significantly reduced by 42%.
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> clearance and volume of distribution were reduced significantly by 75 and 56%, respectively, after administration of the drug with clarithromicyn.
No significant changes of the kinetic of <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> and metabolites were observed.
Influence of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> in healthy male volunteers.
The effect of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> was investigated in 12 healthy male human volunteers.
After an overnight fast, <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> 200 mg was administered to the volunteers, either alone or after 5 days pretreatment with once daily dose of 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> .
Serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> were estimated by reverse phase HPLC.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on non-compartmental model analysis using the computer program KINETICA.
However, time to reach peak concentration, tmax (4 +/- 0.88 vs 4 +/- 0.83 h) and volume of distribution Vd/f (583 +/- 251 vs 710 +/- 690 l/kg) were not affected significantly.
This may be due to increased metabolism of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> due to the induction of cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) in liver.
This interaction has a significant clinical relevance and may warrant dosage adjustment when <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> is co-administered with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> in chronic treatment conditions, such as tuberculosis, leprosy and other infections of joints, bones, etc.
A significant difference was observed in AUC(0-1) (4531.28 +/- 2147 vs 1629.1 +/- 1006 ng x h x ml(-1), p < 0.0001), AUC(0-infinity) (4632.42 +/- 2221.75 vs 1629.46 +/- 1012.61 ng x h x ml(-1), p = 0.0006), Cmax (544.89 +/- 273.91 vs 238.61 +/- 146.34 ng/ml, p = 0.04), t(1/2) (9.3 +/- 3.58 vs 4.0 +/- 1.43 h, p = 0.0317) and CL/F (43.14 +/- 36.23 vs 122.85 +/- 95 l x h(-1), p < 0.0001) of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> administered before and after <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> pretreatment.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> pretreatment reduced the AUC of <START:DRUG> celecoxib <END> by 64% and increased the clearance by 185%.
Effect of the novel anxiolytic drug <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> on cytochrome P(450) 2D6 activity as measured by <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> pharmacokinetics.
In vitro findings have indicated that the novel anxiolytic drug, <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> , is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P(450) (CYP) 2D6 enzyme and co-administration of <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> and the CYP2D6 probe drug <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> is possible in clinical practice.
To evaluate the effects of <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> on CYP2D6 activity as measured by <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> as a positive control for CYP2D6 inhibition.
Fifteen healthy subjects received either 60 mg <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> , 20 mg <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> or matched placebo for 8 days in randomized order in this double-blind, cross-over study.
On day 8 of each study phase, the subjects received a 100-mg single dose of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> and its CYP2D6-dependent metabolite, 2-OH- <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , concentrations were measured for 240 h.
Measurement of secretion of saliva, Visual Analogue Scale assessment of dryness of mouth and tiredness were carried out on day 7 and day 8 to assess the pharmacodynamic consequences of <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> or <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> co-administration with <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
significant correlations were observed with <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> (r(s)=0.84, P<0.001) and <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> (r(s)=0.51, P=0.0498) concentrations and the magnitude of increase of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> AUC.
Both <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> and <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> decreased the formation of 2-OH- <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> in the first-pass phase.
Although <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> seems to be a weaker inhibitor of CYP2D6 than <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be needed when used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> .
Repeated administration of <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> doubled the AUC of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> ( P<0.001), while <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> caused a 4.8-fold increase in the AUC of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> ( P<0.001).
The AUC ratio of 2-OH- <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> / <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> was decreased by 39% ( P<0.001) by <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> and by 74% ( P<0.001) by <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
There were no changes in the secretion of saliva during co-administration of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> with <START:DRUG> deramciclane <END> compared with placebo.
 <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> inhibits <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> disposition and enhances its adrenal-suppressant effect.
 <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> is a potent and selective inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), an enzyme pathway responsible for the biotransformation of a number of steroid compounds.
The potential therefore exists that <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> inhibits the disposition of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> .
In this open label, repeated measures study, the effect of 9 days of <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> administration on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single 0.6 mg/kg intravenous dose of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> was assessed.
Additionally the effect of concomitant <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> use on duration of <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> suppression after <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> administration was assessed.
Eight healthy volunteers completed the study.
The duration of <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> suppression after <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> administration was longer (> or =32 vs. 23.3 +/- 3.43 hours) during <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> administration.
Following <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> administration, the mean (+/-SD) area under the <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> concentration-time curve was significantly higher (1393 +/- 343 vs. 2966 +/- 928 ug*h/L; P < 0.005), apparent clearance was lower (28.7 +/- 7.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 7.8 L/h; P < 0.02) and the terminal elimination half-life was longer (2.28 +/- 0.49 vs. 3.32 +/- 0.95 hours; P < 0.02).
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , and <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> .
The objective of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive one of the four study drugs for 12 days in a parallel study design: <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> 60 mg per day for 5 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 7 days; <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> titrated to a daily dose of 200 mg; <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> titrated to a daily dose of 400 mg; or <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 200 mg per day.
All 40 subjects received oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> solution before and after the 12-day study drug regimen.
Blood samples for determination of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> concentrations were drawn for 24 hours after each <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> dose and used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters.
The effects of the study drugs on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> pharmacodynamics were assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT).
Pharmacodynamic data are consistent with pharmacokinetic data indicating that <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> resulted in significant increases in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> -related cognition impairment.
These results suggest that caution with the use of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> is warranted with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
The mean area under the curve (AUC) for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was increased 771.9% by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and 444.0% by <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> administration.
However, there was no significant change in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> AUC as a result of <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (13.4% decrease) and a statistical trend for <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (66.1% increase) administration.
The significant impairment in subjects' cognitive function reflects the changes in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> clearance after treatment with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> on CYP3A4 in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , a calcium channel blocker, was removed from the market because of adverse drug interactions with coadministered CYP3A4 substrates.
This study examined the effect of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> on the activity of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 in vivo, employing the <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> breath test (EBT) and oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> pharmacokinetics.
This was a two-period, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which 8 male volunteers were randomized to the order of receiving placebo and a single 100-mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> .
Oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was coadministered with intravenous [14C N-methyl] <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> 1 hour after <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> /placebo administration.
The EBT was performed 20 minutes following <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> administration.
Blood and urine were collected during the 36 hours following probe drug administration for analysis of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> pharmacokinetics.
 <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> coadministration decreased the amount of exhaled 14CO2 in 6 of 8 subjects, with a mean decrease of 25%.
It was concluded that a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> significantly inhibits CYP3A4 in intestine and liver.
These data support that adverse drug interactions involving <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> reflect inhibition of CYP3A4 in intestine and liver.
Also, they suggest that the EBT, while a valid probe of in vivo hepatic CYP3A4 activity, is a single time point measurement and may be less sensitive than oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> pharmacokinetics in detecting CYP3A4 inhibition.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> increased the Cmax of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 3-fold, the AUC 8- to 9-fold, and the t1/2 4-fold.
Effect of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> on drug metabolism by induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.
 <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> is a popular herbal product used to treat depression but it has been implicated in drug interactions.
To assess the potential of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> administration to alter the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes extensively involved in drug metabolism.
Open-label crossover study with fixed treatment order conducted March 2002 to February 2003 in a US general clinical research center involving 12 healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women) aged 22 to 38 years before and after 14 days of administration of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> .
Participants were given probe drugs (30 mg of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> and 2 mg of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> ) to establish baseline CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6 activity.
After a minimum 7-day washout period, participants began taking one 300-mg tablet 3 times per day.
After 14 days of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> administration, participants were given the probe drugs along with 1 <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> tablet to establish postadministration CYP activity; the <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> dosing regimen was continued for 48 hours.
Changes in plasma pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> as a probe for CYP 3A4 activity and the ratio of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> to its metabolite, dextrorphan, in urine as a probe for CYP 2D6 activity.
This suggests that long-term administration of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> may result in diminished clinical effectiveness or increased dosage requirements for all CYP 3A4 substrates, which represent at least 50% of all marketed medications.
A 2-fold decrease in the area under the curve for <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> plasma concentration vs time (P<.001) and a 2-fold increase in <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> clearance (P<.001) were observed following <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> administration.
 <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> elimination half-life was shortened from a mean (SD) of 12.4 (3.9) hours to 6.0 (2.4) hours (P<.001).
The mean (SD) urinary ratio of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> to its metabolite was 0.006 (0.010) at baseline and 0.014 (0.025) after <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> administration (P =.26).
A 14-day course of <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> administration significantly induced the activity of CYP 3A4 as measured by changes in <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> pharmacokinetics.
Effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> plasma concentrations in extensive and poor metabolisers of <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> .
To study the influence of CYP3A4 inhibition by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the disposition of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in individuals with different CYP2D6 pheno- and genotypes.
In an open two-phase study, 21 healthy volunteers with known CYP2D6 pheno- and genotype [14 extensive metabolisers (EMs), 7 poor metabolisers (PMs)] were given a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> (50 mg to EMs and 25 mg to PMs).
Plasma and urine levels of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and its three metabolites were measured and the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> were determined.
After a 2-week washout period, subjects were treated for 2 days with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (100 mg twice daily) starting 1 day before the administration of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> ; and the same parameters as for the administration of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> only were measured.
Data were evaluated from 20 subjects (14 EMs and 6 PMs) who completed the study.
The dose-corrected AUC of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was on average 2.3 times higher ( P<0.01) and that of its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine 3.4 times lower ( P<0.0001) in PMs than EMs.
There was a good correlation between the <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> metabolic ratio and the ratio between the AUC of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and that of O-desmethylvenlafaxine ( Rs=0.93, P<0.002).
C(max) values increased by 32% and 18%, respectively.
The precise mechanisms underlying this interaction remain to be elucidated.
The majority of subjects showed higher plasma levels of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and O-desmethylvenlafaxine upon co-administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
AUC of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> significantly increased by 36% and that of O-desmethylvenlafaxine by 26% ( P<0.01).
The elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was unaltered.
Three of the PMs displayed marked increases in AUC (81, 126 and 206%) and C(max) (60, 72, 119%) of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> while the other three showed small or no changes.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> consistently affected the disposition of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in EMs of <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> while the response in PMs was erratic.
Effects of <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> on cytochrome P450 3A4 activity using <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> as a probe.
 <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> is a neurokinin(1) receptor antagonist that enhances prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting when added to conventional therapy with a corticosteroid and a 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) antagonist.
Because <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> may be used with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and ancillary support drugs, which may be substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, assessment of the potential of this drug to inhibit CYP3A4 activity in vivo is important.
The effect of <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> on in vivo CYP3A4 activity in humans with oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> used as a sensitive probe of CYP3A4 activity was evaluated in this study.
In this open-label, randomized, single-period study, 16 healthy male subjects were enrolled.
Subjects received one of two oral <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> regimens for 5 days (8 subjects per regimen): (1) 125 mg <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> on day 1 and then 80 mg/d on days 2 to 5 or (2) 40 mg <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> on day 1 and then 25 mg/d on days 2 to 5.
All subjects also received a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , 2 mg, at prestudy (3 to 7 days before <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> treatment) and on days 1 and 5 (1 hour after <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> administration).
The 5-day 125/80-mg regimen of <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> produced moderateinhibition of CYP3A4 activity in humans, as measured with the use of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> as a probe drug.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and 125/80 mg <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> increased the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 2.3-fold on day 1 (P <.01) and by 3.3-fold on day 5 (P <.01), as compared with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> alone (prestudy).
The 125/80-mg regimen of <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> also increased the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> maximum observed concentration by 1.5-fold on day 1 (P <.05) and by 1.9-fold on day 5 (P <.01).
The <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> half-life values increased from 1.7 hours (prestudy) to 3.3 hours on both day 1 and day 5.
Coadministration of 40/25 mg <START:DRUG> aprepitant <END> and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> did not result in significant changes in the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> area under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum observed concentration, and half-life at either day 1 or day 5.
Interaction between <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> in healthy volunteers.
The interaction between <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> , a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was examined in 16 healthy volunteers.
Subjects received (A) 12.5 mg <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> orally on Day 2 of a 3-day regimen of 400 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> once daily and (B) 12.5 mg <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> in a crossover design.
Plasma and urine concentrations of <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> were measured by HPLC.
Treatment effects on <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> pharmacokinetics were assessed by analysis of variance.
These effects were statistically significant.
The effects of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> clearance were consistent with inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and a slight effect on the active tubular secretion of <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> coadministration increased mean <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> AUC and Cmax from 312 to 490 ng h/mL and 52.6 to 84.5 ng/mL, respectively.
Mean oral clearance was decreased from 40.7 to 26.2 L/h by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , with an accompanying increase in the fraction of <START:DRUG> almotriptan <END> excreted unchanged in the urine (40.6% to 53.3%) and a decrease in renal clearance (16.4 to 13.8 L/h).
Effects of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and their combination on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> : potentially hazardous interaction between <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Our aim was to investigate possible interactions of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and their combination with <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
In a randomised crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received twice daily for 3 days either 600 mg <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , 100 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (first dose 200 mg), both <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , or placebo.
On day 3 they ingested a 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Plasma drug and blood glucose concentrations were followed for 7 h and serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations for 3 h postdose.
Clinicians should be aware of this previously unrecognised and potentially hazardous interaction between <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> .
Concomitant use of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> is best avoided.
If the combination is considered necessary, <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> dosage should be greatly reduced and blood glucose concentrations carefully monitored.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raised the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> 8.1-fold (range 5.5- to 15.0-fold; p<0.001) and prolonged its half-life (t(1/2)) from 1.3 to 3.7 h (p<0.001).
Although <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> alone raised <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> AUC only 1.4-fold (1.1- to 1.9-fold; p<0.001), the <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> - <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> combination raised it 19.4-fold (12.9- to 24.7-fold) and prolonged the t(1/2) of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> to 6.1 h (p<0.001).
Plasma <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> concentration at 7 h was increased 28.6-fold by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> and 70.4-fold by the <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> - <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> combination (p<0.001).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> alone and in combination with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> considerably enhanced and prolonged the blood glucose-lowering effect of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> ; i.e., <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> became a long-acting and stronger antidiabetic.
 <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> is both an inhibitor and a substrate of cytochrome P4502D6 in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> , a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and <START:DRUG> norepinephrine <END> currently undergoing clinical investigation for treatment of depression and stress urinary incontinence, has the potential to act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6).
Our objectives were to determine the effect of <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , a tricyclic antidepressant metabolized by CYP2D6 (study 1), and the effect of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, on <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> pharmacokinetics (study 2).
Subjects were healthy men and women between 21 and 63 years old.
All subjects were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
In study 1, 50 mg of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> was administered as a single dose alone and in the presence of steady-state <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> 60 mg twice daily.
In study 2, steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> 40 mg once daily were determined in the presence and absence of steady-state <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> 20 mg once daily.
Reports of adverse events were similar whether <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> was administered alone or in combination with <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> or <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> 60 mg twice daily is a moderately potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, intermediate between <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> and <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> .
The results of these 2 studies suggest that caution should be used when CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors are coadministered with <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> increased the maximum plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold.
 <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> increased the maximum plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> and the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state 1.6-fold.
The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> has a moderate effect on <START:DRUG> duloxetine <END> concentrations.
Role of CYP2D6 in the stereoselective disposition of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in humans.
CYP2D6 is involved in the O-demethylation metabolic pathway of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in humans.
In this study, we investigated whether this isozyme is stereoselective.
Plasma samples from seven CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and five CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), collected during a period without and with coadministration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , were analysed.
Subjects were administered <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> sulphate every 12 h.
Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h).
The present results show that, although CYP2D6 catalyses the O-demethylation of both enantiomers of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> , it displays a marked stereoselectivity towards the (R)-enantiomer.
The oral clearance of (R)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was found to be nine-fold higher in EMs compared to PMs [median (range) 173 (29-611) l/h versus 20 (16-24) l/h, P < 0.005], while it was two-fold higher for (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> [73 (32-130) l/h versus 37 (21-44) l/h, P < 0.05].
In contrast, data obtained on the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> to N-demethylated metabolites, a reaction which is mediated by CYP3A4, suggest a lack of stereoselectivity of this enzyme.
In EMs, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> decreased (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> oral clearance by 12-fold ( 0.05) and four-fold ( 0.05), respectively.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> did not have any effects on renal clearance of (R)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> [4 (2-10) l/h for <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> alone versus 5 (0.6-7) l/h for <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> + <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ] and of (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> [4 (1-7) l/h for <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> alone versus 3 (0.4-6) l/h for <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> + <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ].
The coadministration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> to EMs resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> to O-demethylated metabolites [127 (10-493) l/h down to 1 (0.1-3) l/h, 0.05], while a seven-fold reduction was measured for (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> [47 (14-94) l/h versus 7 (1-19) l/h, 0.05].
In PMs, coadministration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> did not significantly change oral clearance and partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> to its various metabolites.
The cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> markedly increases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> and enhances its adrenal-suppressant effect.
To examine the possible interaction of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> with orally and intravenously administered <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> .
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with four phases, eight healthy subjects took either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (in two phases) or placebo (in two phases) orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4 each subject received an oral dose of 4.5 mg <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> or an intravenous dose of 5.0 mg <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> sodium phosphate during both <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and placebo phases.
Plasma <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> and <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentrations were determined by HPLC up to 71 hours, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and hydroxyitraconazole up to 23 hours.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreased the systemic clearance of intravenously administered <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> by 68% (P < .001), increased the total area under the plasma <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 3.3-fold (P < .001), and prolonged the elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> 3.2-fold (P < .001).
The AUC(0-infinity) of oral <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> was increased 3.7-fold (P < .001), the peak plasma concentration 1.7-fold (P < .001), and the elimination half-life 2.8-fold (P < .001) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The morning plasma <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentrations measured 47 and 71 hours after administration of <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> were substantially lower after exposure to <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> than to placebo (P < .001).
Accordingly, the adrenal-suppressant effect of <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> was greatly enhanced during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phases.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> markedly increases the systemic exposure to and effects of <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> .
A careful follow-up is recommended when <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or other potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 are added to the drug regimen of patients receiving <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> is a 4-quinolinemethanol compound structurally related to <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> quinine <END> is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme (CYP3A4), whereas <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , a potent inducer of CYP3A4, is known to markedly decrease plasma <START:DRUG> quinine <END> concentration.
Our aim was to study the effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> , and explore a possible role of CYP3A4 on <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> metabolism.
In an open, two-phase crossover study, seven healthy Thai male volunteers received a single oral dose of 500 mg <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> alone, or 500 mg <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> plus a long-term administration of 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Blood samples were collected at specific time points over a 56-day period.
Plasma <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> and its carboxylic acid metabolite were measured by HPLC for pharmacokinetic analysis.
The AUC0 - infinity and CL of the <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> metabolite were increased by 30% and 25%, respectively, but were not significantly different from the control phase.
The CYP3A4 isozyme most likely plays an important role in the enhanced metabolism of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> .
Simultaneous use of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> should be avoided to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> and prevent the risk of Plasmodium falciparum resistance in malarial treatment.
The results indicate that <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0 - infinity) of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> by 68% (P < 0.01), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 19% (P < 0.001), and elimination half-life (t1/2) by 63% (P < 0.01), whereas the time to reach Cmax (t(max)) of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> was unaffected.
The apparent oral clearance (CL) of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> was significantly increased by 281% (P < 0.01).
After administration of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , the Cmax of the carboxylic acid metabolite of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> was significantly increased by 47% (P < 0.05), whereas the t1/2 was significantly decreased by 39% (P < 0.01), and t(max) by 76% (P < 0.01).
The results indicate that <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduces the plasma concentration of a single oral dose of 500 mg <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> by increasing metabolism of <START:DRUG> mefloquine <END> in the liver and gut wall.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> alters the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> to a greater extent than either <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> .
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are metabolized by distinct pathways that may alter the extent of drug-drug interactions.
 <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP2C8.
 <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> is metabolized solely by CYP3A4, and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> metabolism is not well defined.
Coadministration of higher doses of these statins with CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential for eliciting adverse drug-drug interactions.
To determine the comparative effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> , and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> .
In this single-site, randomized, three-way crossover, open-labeled study, healthy subjects (n = 18) received single doses of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> 0.8 mg, <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> 20 mg, or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> 40 mg without and with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> 200 mg.
Pharmacokinetic parameters [AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-tn), peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2)] were determined for parent statins and major metabolites.
The elevation in <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> AUC was significantly greater than that of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> (P < .005) or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (P < .005).
Concomitant <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> / <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> treatment produced small elevations in the <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, and t1/2 (27%, 25%, and 19%, respectively; P < .05 versus <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> alone).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> coadministration produced similar changes in <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> pharmacokinetics [AUC elevated 51% (P < .05 versus <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> alone), 24% (Cmax), and 23% (t1/2), respectively].
However, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> dramatically increased <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> AUC (150%), Cmax (38%), and t1/2 (30%) (P < .05).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> markedly elevated <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> plasma levels (2.5-fold) after 20 mg dosing, suggesting that concomitant <START:DRUG> <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> / <START:DRUG> atorvastatin <END> <END> therapy be carefully considered.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> produced modest elevations in the plasma levels of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> 0.8 mg or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> 40 mg (1.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively), indicating that combination treatment with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> may be preferable.
The effect of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , and their combination on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> .
We studied the effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> in a double-blinded, randomized, four-way cross-over study.
Eight healthy volunteers ingested daily 1500 mg <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> for 6 days, 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> for 5 days (Days 2-6), both <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , or placebo.
On Day 6, each subject received a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> IV over 30 min.
 <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> , 3-hydroxyropivacaine, and 2',6'-pipecoloxylidide in venous plasma and urine samples were measured for up to 12 h and 24 h, respectively.
Implications: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of increased toxicity of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> when used together with inhibitors of CYP1A2.
Concomitant use of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inhibitors further increases <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> concentration.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> 3.7-fold (P: < 0.001), prolonged the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 2.3 to 7.4 h (P: < 0.01), and decreased the clearance by 77% (P: < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> alone had only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> .
However, when compared with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> alone, the combination of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> further increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve and t(1/2) of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> by 50% (P: < 0.01).
We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> considerably reduces elimination of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> .
Concomitant use of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> further increases plasma <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> concentration by decreasing its clearance.
Plasma concentrations of active <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid are increased by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
Concomitant treatment with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , two lipid-lowering drugs, has been associated with occurrence of myopathy in case reports.
The aim of this study was to determine whether <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> affects the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and whether it affects CYP3A4 activity in vitro.
A double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases (placebo and <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> ) was carried out.
Ten healthy volunteers were given <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (600 mg twice daily) or placebo orally for 3 days.
On day 3 they ingested a single 40-mg dose of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid were measured up to 12 hours.
In addition, the effect of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (0 to 1,200 micromol/L) on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation, a CYP3A4 model reaction, was investigated in human liver microsomes in vitro.
In vitro, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> showed no inhibition of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> increases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and, in particular, its active form, <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid, suggesting that the increased risk of myopathy in combination treatment is, at least partially, of a pharmacokinetic origin.
Because <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, the mechanism of the pharmacokinetic interaction is probably inhibition of non-CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> increased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> [AUC(0-infinity)] by 35% (P < .01) and the AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid by 185% (P < .001).
The elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> was increased by 74% (P < .05), and that of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid was increased by 51% (P < .01) by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
The peak concentration of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid was increased by 112%, from 3.20 +/- 2.73 ng/mL to 6.78 +/- 4.67 ng/mL (mean +/- SD; P < .01).
Effect of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on plasma <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> concentrations.
To study the effects of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> , two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.
Two separate randomised, double-blind, two-phase, crossover studies with identical study design were carried out.
In each study, 12 healthy volunteers were given a 4-day pretreatment with oral <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo, according to a randomisation schedule.
On day 4, a single oral dose of 40 mg <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> (study I) or 40 mg <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (study II) was administered orally.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> were measured over 24 h.
"
Care should be taken if <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> or other potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 are prescribed to patients using <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> is not susceptible to interactions with <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> or other potent CYP2C9 inhibitors.
In study 1, <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> increased the mean area under the plasma <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) by 84% (P < 0.01), the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> by 80% (P < 0.01) and its mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 44% (P < 0.05).
In study II, <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> has a significant interaction with <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> .
The mechanism of the increased plasma concentrations and prolonged elimination of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> is probably inhibition of the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> by <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
Pharmacokinetic interactions between <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> / <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
To investigate the effect of the antiretroviral protease inhibitors <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> (soft gelatin capsule) and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on the pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and to investigate the effect of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Two independent, 8 day, open, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (containing a double-blind crossover phase) were conducted at Pfizer Clinical research units (Canterbury, UK.
and Brussels, Belgium).
Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers entered each study.
In each study, volunteers were randomized (n = 14 per group) to receive <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on day 1 followed by a 7-day treatment period (days 2-8) with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> or placebo (Study I) or <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> or placebo (Study II).
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> or placebo (Study I and Study II) was administered alternately on day 7 or day 8, depending on initial randomization.
The effect of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and its primary circulating metabolite ( <START:DRUG> uK-103, 320 <END> ) and the effect of single-dose <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> (1200 mg three times daily) and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (500 mg twice daily) were determined.
The safety and tolerability of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> coadministered with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> or <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> were also assessed.
This compared with increases of 3.1-fold (95% CI: 2.5, 4.0) and 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.8, 3.3) for coadministration with <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> .
The increases in systemic exposure to <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and <START:DRUG> uK-103, 320 <END> were not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events or clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate or ECG parameters.
The more pronounced effect of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> may be attributed to its additional potent inhibition of CYP2C9.
No change in safety or tolerability was observed when <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> was coadministered with either protease inhibitor.
However, given the extent of the interactions, a lower <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> starting dose (25 mg) should be considered for patients receiving <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and it is recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg in a 48 h period for patients receiving <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Both protease inhibitors significantly increased Cmax, AUC, tmax and t(1/2) values for both <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and <START:DRUG> uK-103, 320 <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> showed a significantly greater effect than <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> with increases in <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> AUC and Cmax of 11-fold (95% CI: 9.0, 12.0) and 3.9-fold (95% CI: 3.2, 4.9), respectively.
In contrast, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> were unaffected by <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
These results indicate that both <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> modify the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> presumably through inhibition of CYP3A4.
The effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> .
To examine the possible effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> .
In this double-blind, randomised, two-phase cross-over study, ten healthy subjects received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, 20 mg <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> was given orally.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> , <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and hydroxyitraconazole were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography up to 47 h.
"
The susceptibility of <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> to interact with CYP3A4 inhibitors is considerably smaller than that of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> , and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and probably also other inhibitors of CYP3A4 can be used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> without marked changes in the effects of this corticosteroid.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the total area under the plasma <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> concentration-time curve by 24% (P < 0.001) and the elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> by 29% (P < 0.001) compared with placebo.
The peak plasma concentration and time to the peak of <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> were not affected by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The mean morning plasma <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentration, measured 23 h after the ingestion of <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> , during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase was 73% of that during the placebo phase (P < 0.001).
The observed minor interaction between <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and oral <START:DRUG> prednisolone <END> is probably of limited clinical significance.
Influence of <START:DRUG> hydroxychloroquine <END> on the bioavailability of oral <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> .
 <START:DRUG> hydroxychloroquine <END> (HCQ) is used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Since there is great interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of HCQ and <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6-catalysed pathways in vitro, we wished to study the interaction of HCQ with CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of other drugs in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> and <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> (DM) were selected as probe drugs because they are well-studied and widely used test substrates of CYP2D6.
In this randomized, double-blind crossover study, seven healthy volunteers with extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6 ingested either 400 mg <START:DRUG> hydroxychloroquine <END> or placebo daily for 8 days after which single oral dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> were investigated.
 <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> metabolic ratio (DM-MR) was also determined at baseline and after the ingestion of HCQ or placebo.
While the DM-MR values were not significantly changed, the phenotypic classification of one individual, who was heterozygous for a mutant CYP2D6 allele, was converted to a poor metabolizer by HCQ administration.
Concomitant administration of HCQ increased the bioavailability of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> , as indicated by significant increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (65 +/- 4.6%) and maximal plasma concentrations (72 +/- 6.9%) of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> .
HCQ inhibits <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism most probably by inhibiting its biotransformation by CYP2D6.
The inhibitory effect of HCQ on <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> metabolism was not apparent when DM-MR was used as an indicator, except in an individual with limited CYP2D6 capacity.
Influence of CYP2D6 activity on the disposition and cardiovascular toxicity of the antidepressant agent <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> in humans.
According to in-vitro studies with microsomes from human livers and from yeast expression systems with high CYP2D6 activity, the major oxidation pathway of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> is catalysed by CYP2D6.
In this study, we investigated the role of the CYP2D6 polymorphism and the effects of low-dose <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a selective inhibitor of, CYP2D6, on the disposition of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> .
Fourteen healthy men, eight with the extensive metabolizer and six with the poor metabolizer phenotype were administered <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> sulfate 100 mg every 12 h.
Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h).
When <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was administered alone, the oral clearance of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> was more than fourfold less in poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers (P < 0.05).
This was mainly due to a decreased capability of poor metabolizers to form O-desmethylated metabolites at the position 4 of the aromatic moiety.
decreased CYP2D6 activity could also be associated with cardiovascular toxicity as observed in four patients during treatment with the drug.
Thus, genetically determined or pharmacologically altered CYP2D6 activity represents a major determinant of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> disposition in humans.
In extensive metabolizers, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> decreased <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> oral clearance from 100 +/- 62 l/h to 17 +/- 5 l/h (mean +/- SD; P < 0.05) without any effects on renal clearance (4 +/- 1 l/h during <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> alone and 4 +/- 1 l/h during <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> plus <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ).
In these individuals, the sequential metabolism of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> to O-desmethylvenlafaxine and to N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> coadministration so that metabolic clearances to O-desmethylated metabolites decreased from 43 +/- 32 l/h to 2 +/- 1 l/h (P < 0.05).
In poor metabolizers, coadministration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> did not cause significant changes in oral clearance and partial metabolic clearances of <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> to its various metabolites.
The effects of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> pharmacokinetics--a placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers.
To assess the effects of multiple oral doses of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> HCl.
This was a 14-day, open-label, randomized, crossover study in 14 healthy subjects aged 18-31 years.
Group 1 received oral <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 400 mg once daily for 6 days, followed by a 2 day wash-out period and 6 days of placebo administration.
Group 2 received placebo followed by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Single oral doses of <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> HCl 40 mg were administered on days 5 and 13 in both groups.
 <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administration periods.
Mean Cmax increased by 34%, from 89 ng ml(-1) to 119 ng ml(-1), respectively.
The treatment effect on both of these parameters was statistically significant (P<0.02).
Most adverse events were of mild intensity.
There were no serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, abnormal ECGs, or clinically significant alterations in vital signs throughout the study.
This suggests that other inhibitors of CYP3A4 are unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> .
Co-administration of <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was associated with a modest increase in <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> exposure; mean <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> AUC(0,infinity) increased by 33%, from 899 ng ml(-1) h with placebo to 1199 ng ml(-1) h with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
The concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> led to modest, statistically significant increases in <START:DRUG> ziprasidone <END> exposure, although the changes seen were not considered clinically relevant.
Effect of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> .
In vitro results suggest that <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 1A2, 2D6, 3A4 and 2C19.
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (a CYP2C19 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> .
This study was conducted as a single-centre, open-label, nonrandomised, 2-period, crossover pharmacokinetic trial.
A single 100 mg dose of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> was administered orally on days 0 and 14.
Oral <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (40 mg every day) was administered on days 7 to 18.
20 healthy nonsmoking male and female volunteers.
Serial blood samples were collected before and after <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> administration to characterise the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> and its metabolites.
For the 2 major circulating metabolites, OPC-13015 and OPC-13213, the OPC-13015 Cmax and AUCt increased by 29 and 69%, respectively (p < 0.001).
However, for OPC-13213, the Cmax and AUCt decreased by 22 and 31%, respectively (p < 0.001).
The plasma protein binding of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> was unaffected by coadministration of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
For the other active metabolite, OPC-13213, systemic exposure decreased by 31% because of inhibition of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> metabolism to this metabolite.
These changes in systemic exposure were well tolerated.
A dose of 50 mg <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> twice a day should be considered during coadministration of inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
Following <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> coadministration, the increases in <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at time t (AUCt) were 18% (p = 0.062) and 26% (p < 0.001), respectively.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> resulted in an increase in the systemic exposure of <START:DRUG> cilostazol <END> and its active metabolite, OPC-13015, by 26 and 69%, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> concentrations and <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> .
 <START:DRUG> st John's wort <END> reduced the area under the curve of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> by a mean of 57% (SD 19) and decreased the extrapolated 8-h <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> trough by 81% (16) in healthy volunteers.
A reduction in <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> exposure of this magnitude could lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure.
Simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity in vivo with <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> (ALP) and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (CAF) were suggested as probe drugs for the activities of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, respectively.
We investigated the disposition of oral ALP (1 mg) and CAF (100 mg) in 17 normal volunteers to establish and validate a procedure for the simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzyme activity.
Nine received ALP alone, ALP and CAF and CAF alone in an open three-way crossover study to test for pharmacokinetic interaction.
Four received ALP after a 2-day pretreatment with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and four normal volunteers received ALP after 4 days of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , an inducer of CYP3A4.
AUC values of ALP and CAF administered alone were not different from AUC values when both drugs were administered combined, indicating that there is no metabolic interaction.
The ratio formed of paraxanthine and CAF correlated significantly with systemic CAF clearance at 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h.
There was a strong correlation between AUC values of ALP and CAF and the plasma concentration obtained 6, 8, 10, or 24 h after ingestion of the drug.
We conclude that ALP and CAF can be administered simultaneously for the assessment of CYP activity.
Plasma concentrations 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after drug ingestion reflect AUC of ALP and CAF and therefore in-vivo CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> pretreatment significantly changed AUC values of ALP (mean AUC values in microg/l h: ALP = 242.2, ALP + <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> = 426.2, ALP + <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> = 28.4, ANOVA F = 17.7, P < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> but not <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> substantially elevates the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
The calcium channel blockers <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> and <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro.
However, their in vivo inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 are not known in detail, although <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> was recently withdrawn from the market because of serious drug interactions.
The effects of <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> and <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> , a model substrate of CYP3A4, were studied in a randomized, double-blind crossover study with three phases.
Nine healthy subjects took 50 mg <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , 5 mg <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> , or placebo orally once a day for 3 days.
On day 3, each subject received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
Thereafter, blood samples were collected up to 18 hours, and pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> were measured up to 8 hours.
 <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> increased the total area under the plasma <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration-time curve [AUC(0 - infinity)] 9-fold compared with placebo (P < .001).
The peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> was increased 1.8-fold (3.4+/-0.1 ng/mL versus 1.8+/-0.2 ng/mL [mean +/- SEM]; P < .001), and the elimination half-life (t 1/2) was increased 4.9-fold (18.5+/-1.9 hours versus 4.0+/-0.5 hours; P < .001) by <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> .
In addition, <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> was associated with increased pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
In contrast to <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> reduced the AUC(0 - infinity) and t 1/2 of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> by about 20% (P < .05) and had no significant effects on the pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> but not <START:DRUG> isradipine <END> markedly increases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and thereby enhances and prolongs its pharmacodynamic effects, consistent with potent inhibition of CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> inhibits the clearance of the enantiomers of the antidepressant <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> in humans.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.
 <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> , a selective <START:DRUG> norepinephrine <END> reuptake inhibitor, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.
The potential interaction of <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> with this representative from the azole derivative class was examined.
Eleven healthy volunteers received (1) 4 mg <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> orally on the second day of a 5-day regimen of 200 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> once daily and (2) 4 mg <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> orally in a crossover design.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> enantiomers [R,R(-)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> and the more active S,S(+)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> ] were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Effects of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on enantiomer pharmacokinetics were assessed by ANOVA.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> did not significantly affect maximal plasma concentrations (P > .1).
Although the adverse effect profile for <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> was not altered by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , the results of this study suggest that caution should be used and that a reduction in <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> dose should be considered when the two are coadministered.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased R,R(-)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> and S,S(+)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> mean area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) by 58% and 43%, respectively (P < .02).
Oral clearance of both enantiomers was consequently decreased 34% and 24%, respectively, by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (P < .005).
Mean terminal half-life after administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (21.5 hours and 18.9 hours) was significantly longer than after <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> alone (14.8 hours and 14.4 hours; P < or = .005).
The AUC ratio for R,R(-)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> to S,S(+)- <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> was reduced by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administration (2.76 after <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> versus 2.39; P < .003).
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> decreases clearance of both <START:DRUG> reboxetine <END> enantiomers.
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> has minimal effects on plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> -derived 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.
To evaluate the effect of regular-strength <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , a cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of a commonly prescribed regimen of oral <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
In a randomized crossover study, 16 healthy subjects received a single 40 mg dose of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> in the evening after each consumed an 8-ounce glass of regular-strength <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> or water with breakfast for 3 consecutive days.
The effect of the same <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> and water regimen on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (2 mg oral dose given 1 hour after the third day of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> and water) was used as a positive control in the same subjects.
Plasma concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, and concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid, and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Similar effects on AUC and Cmax (approximately 40% increase for each) were noted after analysis of samples of hydrolyzed plasma (which converts inactive lactones to active hydroxy acid species).
Daily consumption of a glass of regular-strength <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> has a minimal effect on plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (approximately 30% to 40% increase) after a 40 mg evening dose of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
The area under the plasma concentration-time profiles (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increased slightly (-30% for each) after consumption of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> .
The AUC and Cmax values for <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> approximately doubled in the presence of <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , whereas the same parameters for <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid increased 1.6-fold.
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> caused the AUC for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> to increase by a factor of approximately 2.4.
Interaction of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> when co-administered to HIV-positive patients.
The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in HIV-infected men is estimated to be 33%.
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, Kent, UK) is the first oral drug for this condition.
Since <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and the protease inhibitors are both metabolized by, and act as inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of the combination <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> plus <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> in HIV-infected patients.
Six patients at steady state in treatment with <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> participated in the study.
On the first day blood samples for <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> assay were drawn at times 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h after dosing.
On the second study day patients received a single dose of 25 mg of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> in addition to their routine morning medication.
Blood samples were taken as described.
Separated plasma was stored at -80 degrees C until analysis by high performance liquid chromatography.
In a parallel study, the effect of <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> on the in vitro hepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> was assessed.
The geometric mean area under the concentration curve for 0-8 h (AUC0-8h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> were 19.69 microg/ml h (range, 9.19-31.99 microg/ml h) and 7.02 microg/ml (range, 2.33-16.17 microg/ml), respectively, on the first study day.
The geometric mean AUC0-8h and Cmax for <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> were 1631 ng/ml h (range, 643-2970 ng/ml h) and 384 ng/ml (range, 209-766 ng/ml) respectively.
The AUC for <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> was 4.4 times higher than data from historical controls given either 50 mg or 100 mg of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> and dose normalized to 25 mg.
 <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> was a potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> hepatic metabolism in vitro [concentration producing 50% inhibition of control enzyme activity (IC50) = 0.39 +/- 0.17 microM, mean +/- SD].
The magnitude of this interaction suggests a lower starting dose of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> may be more appropriate in this clinical setting.
In the presence of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> , the mean AUC0-8h and Cmax of <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> were 22.37 microg/ml h [range, 10.08-37.25 microg/ml h; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference between means, -15 to 13.25) and 9.11 microg/ml (range, 3.41-22.78 microg/ml; 95% CI, -13 to 6.37), respectively.
Co-administration of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> 25 mg did not significantly alter the plasma <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> levels.
However, plasma <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> AUC was markedly increased in the presence of <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> compared with historical controls.
From the in vitro data, the mechanism of increase is <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
altered pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> by a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( <START:DRUG> hBY-097 <END> ): a pharmacokinetic evaluation in HIV-positive patients.
 <START:DRUG> hBY-097 <END> (HBY), an investigational nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> (IDV) share a common metabolic pathway, cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4), and may clinically be used together as well as with <START:DRUG> zidovudine <END> (ZDV).
Thus, the potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between these drugs was evaluated.
HBY (500 mg Q8H), IDV (800 mg Q8H), and ZDV (200 mg Q8H) were given to 8 HIV-infected subjects.
Serial plasma samples were collected at baseline (ZDV and IDV alone) and day 11 (all 3 drugs) to determine PK parameters using noncompartmental analysis.
PK parameters for ZDV in the presence and absence of HBY were not appreciably different.
The increase in IDV CL/F is consistent with the observed metabolic induction effects of other NNRTIs.
However, both the maximum (Cmax) and minimum (Cmin) concentrations of IDV were significantly reduced, from a mean of 7514 +/- 1636 and 146 +/- 81 mcg/L to 4725 +/- 2494 mcg/L and 54 +/- 24 mcg/L (p < .05) after addition of HBY.
Furthermore, apparent clearance (CL/F) of IDV before and after 11 days of concomitant HBY administration was significantly higher, from 0.69 +/- 0.14 to 1.94 +/- 0.63 L/h/kg (p < .05) with an associated reduction in area under the curve (AUC0-8) from 16,034 +/- 4903 to 6134 +/- 2701 mg/L/h (p < .05).
The results of this trial showed that HBY significantly alters the pharmacokinetic parameters of IDV at the dose studied.
Effects of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> in relation to CYP2C19 genotype status in humans.
A triple therapy with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> amoxicillin <END> (INN, amoxicilline), and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> is widely used for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> are metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
This study aimed to elucidate whether <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> affects the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
After administration of placebo or 400 mg <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> twice a day for 3 days, 20 mg <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and placebo or 400 mg <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> were administered to 21 healthy volunteers.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> and their metabolites were determined before and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 24 hours after dosing.
CYP2C19 genotype status was determined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
Subjects were classified into three groups on the basis of PCR-RFLP analyses for CYP2C19: homozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 6), heterozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 11), and poor metabolizer group (n = 4).
There were significant differences in the mean AUC values of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> among the three groups.
Drug interaction between <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> may underlie high eradication rates achieved by triple therapy with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> amoxicillin <END> , and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> .
Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 hours (AUC) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> in the homozygous extensive metabolizer, heterozygous extensive metabolizer, and poor metabolizer groups were significantly increased by <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> from 383.9 to 813.1, from 1001.9 to 2110.4, and from 5589.7 to 13098.6 ng x h/mL, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> inhibits the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
Duration of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) inhibition and estimation of functional CYP2E1 enzyme half-life after single-dose <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> administration in humans.
 <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> (DSF) is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1), resulting in loss of CYP2E1 protein and activity, which may be useful in preventing CYP2E1-mediated xenobiotic toxicity.
The duration of inhibition after a single DSF dose is, however, unknown.
The purpose of this investigation was to determine this duration, and CYP2E1 formation and degradation rates, in humans.
Oral <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CLZ) was used as the selective in vivo probe for CYP2E1.
Healthy subjects received CLZ to determine baseline CYP2E1 activity (CLZ plasma clearance and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone fractional metabolic clearance).
One week later, DSF (500 mg orally) was administered at bedtime, and CLZ administered the following morning and 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days after DSF.
A terminal DSF metabolite, 2-thiothiazolidine-4 carboxylic acid, was also measured in each 24-h urine sample.
The mean CLZ clearance and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone fractional metabolic clearance on the first day declined to 10.2 and 5.5% of baseline values, indicating rapid and profound CYP2E1 inhibition.
CYP2E1 activity returned to half that of control on day 3, and to baseline values on day 8.
Assuming zero-order synthesis and first-order degradation, the in vivo CYP2E1 synthesis rate and degradation half-life was estimated to be 11 +/- 5 nmol/h and 50 +/- 19 h, respectively.
significant amounts of 2-thiothiazolidine-4 carboxylic acid were present only on day 1, suggesting that the return of in vivo CYP2E1 activity was not caused by inhibitor washout, but by enzyme resynthesis.
Results regarding CYP2E1 disposition may be useful for modeling the effects of CYP2E1 inducers and inhibitors.
For prevention of CYP2E1-mediated bioactivation, depending on protoxicant disposition, a second DSF dose might be necessary to completely prevent toxicity.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 's role in reducing <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> clearance and prolonging its half-life.
The human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 's concomitant administration with the substrates of this enzyme may lead to dangerous drug interactions.
The authors investigated possible interactions between <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> and intravenously administered <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in two phases.
Twelve healthy volunteers received orally <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> or placebo for 3 days; the dose of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was 200 mg three times on the first day and 300 mg three times on the second.
The last dose of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> 300 mg or placebo was given on the morning of the third day.
On the second day, 2 h after the afternoon pretreatment dose, <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> 5 microg/kg was injected intravenously in 2 min with <START:DRUG> naloxone <END> to moderate its effects, and 15 timed venous blood samples were collected for 18 h.
"
One subject discontinued participation before <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> administration because of severe side effects, and during the study 8 of the remaining 11 subjects reported nausea.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> reduced the clearance of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> by 67% from 15.6+/-8.2 to 5.2+/-2.0 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1) (P<0.01).
The area under the <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 18 h was increased from 4.8+/-2.7 to 8.8+/-2.3 ng x ml(-1) x h(-1) by <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (P<0.01).
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> did not affect the initial concentrations and the steady-state volume of distribution of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> can inhibit the metabolism of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> significantly, so caution should be exercised if <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> is given to patients receiving <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> medication.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> is a potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> metabolism in vivo.
In vitro studies have shown that <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2).
One of the monohydroxy-metabolites has been incriminated with <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> -induced hepatotoxicity.
The aim of this study was to establish whether the potent CYP1A2 inhibitor <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> in clinically relevant doses could inhibit <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> metabolism.
Eighteen healthy young men were enrolled in an open, randomized crossover study.
In the first study period a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> 40 mg was given.
In the second period the volunteers were randomized to maintenance doses of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> 50 or 100 mg per day, and a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> 20 mg was given.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> was found to be a very potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> metabolism.
The medians of the steady-state concentration of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> were 43 nM (range 25-49) and 70 nM (range 44-124) in the 50 mg per day and 100 mg per day groups, respectively.
The steady-state concentration of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> correlated with the fractional decrement in <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> clearance (Spearman Rs = 0.53, P < 0.05).
This interaction is very likely to have clinical relevance.
Whether concomitant <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment reduces <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> -induced hepatotoxicity needs further study.
A fractional decrement in <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> clearance of approximately 85% was found with both <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> doses, which was in good agreement with a prediction based on in vitro data.
modest, but statistically significant, reductions in the formation of the metabolites 1- and 2-hydroxytacrine were found during concomitant <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> at clinically relevant doses is a potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> tacrine <END> metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreases the clearance and enhances the effects of intravenously administered <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> in healthy volunteers.
A possible interaction of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with intravenously administered <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> , was examined.
In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase cross-over study, 9 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or matched placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, a dose of 16 mg <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> as sodium succinate was administered intravenously.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> , <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and hydroxyitraconazole were determined up to 24 hr.
The volume of distribution of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> was not affected by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Care should be taken when <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the total area under the plasma <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity) 2.6-fold) (P<0.001), while the AUC (12-24) of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> was increased 12.2-fold (P<0.001).
The systemic clearance of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase was 40% of that during the placebo phase (P<0.01).
The mean elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> was increased from 2.1+/-0.3 hr to 4.8+/-0.8 hr (P<0.001) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The mean morning plasma <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentration during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase, measured 24 hr after the administration of <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> , was only about 9% of that during the placebo phase (11.0+/-9.0 ng/ml versus 117+/-49.2 ng/ml; P<0.001).
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreases the clearance and increases the elimination half-life of intravenously administered <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> , resulting in greatly increased exposure to <START:DRUG> methylprednisolone <END> during the night time and in enhanced adrenal suppression.
The effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> is an antiemetic agent metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and some other CYP enzymes.
We examined the possible effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> .
In a randomized crossover study with 4 phases and a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers took either 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (in 2 phases) or placebo (in 2 phases) once a day for 5 days.
On day 6, 8 mg <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> was administered either orally (after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and placebo) or intravenously (after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and placebo).
 <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> concentrations in plasma were measured up to 12 hours.
The interaction is most likely the result of induction of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> .
The mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of orally administered <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> pretreatment was reduced by 65% compared with placebo (P < .001).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> decreased the peak plasma concentration of oral <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> by about 50% (from 27.2+/-3.0 to 13.8+/-1.5 ng/mL [mean +/- SEM]; P < .001]) and the elimination half-life (t1/2) by 38% (P < .01).
The bioavailability of oral <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> was reduced from 60% to 40% (P < .01) by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
The clearance of intravenous <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> was increased 83% (from 440+/-38.4 to 805+/-44.6 mL/min [P < .001]) by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the t1/2 of intravenously administered <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> by 46% (P < .001) and the AUC(0-infinity) by 48% (P < .001).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> considerably decreases the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> after both oral and intravenous administration.
Concomitant use of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 with <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> may result in a reduced antiemetic effect, particularly after oral administration of <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> .
The effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> .
The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> .
A single dose of <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> 5 mg immediate-release tablet was administered either alone or in combination with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 200 mg (4 days pretreatment and concomitant administration) in a randomized crossover trial in seven healthy male CAUCasian volunteers.
Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles of <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> and its metabolite M9 were determined.
The <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> -induced increase in plasma concentration of the metabolite M9 was of similar magnitude.
The interaction is attributed to inhibition of cytochrome 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and other antifungal drugs of the substituted <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> type as well as other potent inhibitors of cytochrome 3A4 should not be used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> .
Pre-treatment with and concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> resulted in a 24-fold and 11-fold, increase in mean AUC and Cmax of <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> , respectively, compared with treatment with <START:DRUG> nisoldipine <END> 5 mg alone.
Effect of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine.
Lignocaine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4), and has a moderate to high extraction ratio resulting in oral bioavailability of 30%.
We have studied the possible effect of two inhibitors of CYP3A4, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine in nine volunteers using a cross-over study design.
The subjects were given <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> orally (500 mg three times a day), <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (200 mg once a day) or placebo for four days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single dose of 1 mg/kg of oral lignocaine.
Plasma samples were collected until 10 hr and concentrations of lignocaine and its major metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide were measured by gas chromatography.
Compared to placebo and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> increased monoethylglycinexylidide peak concentrations by approximately 40% (P<0.01) and AUC(0-infinity) by 60% (P<0.01).
The extent of the interaction of lignocaine with these CYP3A4 inhibitors was, however, less than that of, e.g. <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> or <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> , and it did not correlate with the CYP3A4 inhibiting potency of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Both <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the area under the lignocaine plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] and lignocaine peak concentrations by 40-70% (P<0.05).
The clinical implication of this study is that <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> may significantly increase the plasma concentrations and toxicity of oral lignocaine.
Effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> pharmacokinetics.
To determine the effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> , a competitive 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor.
A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study design with two phases, which were separated by a washout period of 4 weeks, was used.
In each phase ten healthy volunteers took 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days according to a randomization schedule.
On day 4, 0.3 mg <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> was administered orally.
Serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> , its major metabolites, active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and hydroxyitraconazole were measured up to 24 h.
"
The AUC(0-24h) and t1/2 of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased by 27% (P < 0.05) and 40% (P < 0.05), respectively, by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated M-1 metabolic pathway leads to elevated serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> lactone and metabolite M-23, resulting in increased concentrations of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of the parent <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> by 15% (P < 0.05).
The mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> lactone was increased 1.8-fold (range 1.1-fold to 2.4-fold, P < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24h) 2.6-fold (range 2.0-fold to 3.6-fold, P < 0.001) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The elimination half-life (t1/2) of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> lactone was increased 3.2-fold (P < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreased the AUC(0-24h) of the active M-1 metabolite of <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> by 28% (P < 0.05), whereas the AUC(0- 24h) of the more active metabolite, M-23, was increased by 36% (P < 0.05).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> has a modest interaction with <START:DRUG> cerivastatin <END> .
Effects of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> is a marketed immunosuppressant used in liver and kidney transplantation.
It is subject to extensive metabolism by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.
A pharmacokinetic interaction with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , an antituberculosis agent and potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> was evaluated in six healthy male volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> was administered at doses of 0.1 mg/kg orally and 0.025 mg/kg/4 hours intravenously.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> were obtained from serial blood samples collected over 96 hours, after single oral and intravenous administration prior to and during an 18-day concomitant <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> dosing phase.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly increased <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> clearance (36.0 +/- 8.1 ml/hr/kg vs. 52.8 +/- 9.6 ml/hr/kg; p = 0.03) and decreased <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> bioavailability (14.4% +/- 5.7% vs. 7.0% +/- 2.7%; p = 0.03).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> appears to induce both intestinal and hepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> tacrolimus <END> , most likely through induction of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in the liver and small bowel.
 <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> concentrations in plasma are greatly decreased by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in drug metabolism and therefore causes many drug interactions.
The effects of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> (study I) and <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> (study II) were examined in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies.
Ten (study I) or 9 (study II) healthy male volunteers took either 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
On the sixth day, 80 mg <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> or 120 mg <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> was administered orally.
Blood samples were collected up to 336 hours after drug administration.
Concomitant use of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 with <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> may reduce the efficacy of these antiestrogens.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> reduced the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> by 86% (P < .001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 55% (P < .001), and elimination half-life (t1/2) by 44% (P < .001).
The AUC of <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> was reduced by 87% (P < .001), Cmax by 55% (P < .001), and t1/2 by 44% (P < .01) with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
During the <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> phase, the AUC of N-demethyltamoxifen was 38% (P < .001) and the AUC of N-demethyltoremifene was 20% (P < .01) of that during the placebo phase.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> markedly reduces the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> toremifene <END> by inducing their CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.
Concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> HCl and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> : assessment of pharmacokinetic changes following single and multiple doses.
The aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> HCl and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> separately, and in combination, following administration of single and multiple oral doses.
This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study in healthy volunteers (n=21).
During each treatment period, subjects received single daily doses of either <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> HCl (5 mg), <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (200 mg), or a combination of both drugs for 7 consecutive days.
Pharmacokinetic comparisons were made between treatment groups for the day 1 and day 7 profiles.
Each treatment period was followed by a 3-week, drug-free washout period.
The concurrent administration of both drugs resulted in a 12% greater Cmax (9.5 ng ml(-1) versus 8.4 ng ml(-1); P=0.01) and a 12% greater AUC(0-24) (135.2 ng h ml(-1) versus 118.7 ng h ml(-1); P=0.001) than <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> alone on day 1, and a 26.8% greater Cmax (37.7 ng ml(-1) versus 27.6 ng ml(-1); P < 0.0001) and a 26.4% greater AUC(0-24) (680.9 ng h ml(-1) versus 501.0 ng h ml(-1); P<0.0001) than <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> alone on day 7.
These observed changes, which are smaller than those produced by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> for other agents sharing the CYP-3A4 pathway, are most likely the result of <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> also being metabolized by CYP-2D6, as well as its slow rate of clearance from plasma.
On both day 1 and day 7, a statistically significant difference was observed between the <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> and the <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> + <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment groups in terms of Cmax and AUC(0-24) of <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> .
In contrast, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> plasma concentrations were unaffected by the concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> , and there were no statistically significant differences in <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> pharmacokinetics when <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administered alone was compared with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administered with <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> .
The concurrent administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> produces no change in <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> plasma concentrations, but a statistically significant change in <START:DRUG> donepezil <END> plasma concentrations.
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> in humans is mediated by CYP1A2 and to a minor extent by CYP3A4: an interaction study with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> as in vivo inhibitors.
Potential drug-drug interactions can be identified in vitro by exploring the importance of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes for drug metabolism.
The metabolism of the local anesthetic <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> to 3-hydroxyropivacaine and (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide was shown in vitro to be dependent on CYP1A2 and 3A4, respectively.
In this in vivo model study we quantitated the role of these 2 isozymes for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> .
In a randomized, 3-way crossover study, 12 healthy subjects received a single dose of 40 mg <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> intravenously alone or combined either with 25 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> as a CYP1A2 inhibitor or with 100 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> as a CYP3A4 inhibitor twice daily for 2 days.
Venous plasma and urine samples were collected over 10 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
The samples were analyzed for <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> base, 3-hydroxyropivacaine, and (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide.
The relative changes in unbound plasma clearance were similar to the changes in total plasma clearance.
Coadministration with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> almost abolished the (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide concentrations in plasma, whereas <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> administration increased the (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide levels.
The fraction of dose excreted as 3-hydroxyropivacaine in urine decreased during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> administration from 39% to 13%.
CYP1A2 is the most important isozyme for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> .
Drug-drug interactions with strong inhibitors of this isozyme could be of clinical relevance during repeated administration.
A potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 causes a minor decrease in clearance, which should be of no clinical relevance.
Coadministration with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> decreased the mean total plasma clearance of <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> from 354 to 112 mL/min (68%), whereas <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> decreased plasma clearance to 302 mL/min (15%).
The <START:DRUG> ropivacaine <END> half-life (t1/2) of 1.9 hours was almost doubled during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> administration and the plasma concentration at the end of infusion increased slightly, whereas the corresponding parameters after <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administration remained unchanged.
Effect of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous lignocaine.
We have studied the possible interaction of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , both inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4), with intravenous lignocaine in nine healthy volunteers using a randomized cross-over study design.
The subjects were given oral placebo, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (500 mg three times a day) or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (200 mg once a day) for 4 days.
Intravenous lignocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) was given with an infusion for 60 min on the fourth day of pretreatment with placebo, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Timed plasma samples were collected until 11 h.
The concentrations of lignocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were measured by gas chromatography.
Following <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> administration, t1/2 was 2.6 h.
The values for plasma clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were similar during all the phases.
Further studies are necessary to elucidate the clinical significance of the <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> -induced elevated concentrations of MEGX during prolonged intravenous infusions of lignocaine.
The area under the lignocaine concentration-time curve was similar during all three phases but <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> significantly increased the elimination half-life of lignocaine from 2.5 to 2.9 (0.7) h compared with placebo.
Compared with placebo and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> significantly increased MEGX peak concentrations by approximately 40% and AUC(0-11 h) by 45-60%.
The plasma decay of lignocaine administered intravenously is virtually unaffected by the concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> increases the concentrations of MEGX, which indicates that <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> either increases the relative amount of lignocaine metabolized via N-de-ethylation or decreases the further metabolism of MEGX.
Effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
To assess the effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> , the study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover manner with two phases of treatment with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> -placebo or placebo- <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Ten healthy male subjects receiving <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> 200 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an oral 0.8 mg dose of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> on day 4 of each treatment phase.
Plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> was measured up to 48 h after <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske undersøgelser side effect rating scale.
The test performed during <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function.
Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 ng h/ml), decreased the apparent oral clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.10 ml/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
It is suggested that <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> via its inhibitory effects on <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> metabolism.
Enhanced side effects of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes.
Effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> therapy on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A as determined by phenotyping.
To determine the effect of 150 mg/day <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A, N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2), and xanthine oxidase (XO) by phenotyping with <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
Oral <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (2 mg/kg), oral <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> (30 mg), and intravenous <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (0.025 mg/kg) were administered to 10 white male volunteers every 14 days for 4 months and to 10 white premenopausal female volunteers during the midfollicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle for 4 complete cycles (8 total phenotyping measures).
The first 6 phenotyping measures were used to establish baseline activity.
Subjects were given 150 mg/day <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> for the fourth month or cycle of the study.
Enzyme activity for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, NAT2, and XO was expressed as urinary metabolite ratios.
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> plasma clearance was used to express CYP3A activity.
No difference between baseline and weeks 2 and 4 of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> therapy was observed for NAT2 or XO metabolite ratios.
For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A phenotypes, significant differences existed between baseline and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> therapy.
For CYP1A2, the mean urinary metabolite ratio (+/-SD) was 7.53 +/- 7.44 at baseline and 4.30 +/- 2.82 with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> ( P = .012).
Mean CYP2D6 molar urinary <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> ratios before and after <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> therapy were 0.00780 +/- 0.00694 and 0.0153 +/- 0.0127, respectively (P = .011).
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> clearance decreased from 0.0081 +/ 0.0024 L/min/kg at baseline to 0.0054 +/- 0.0021 L/min/kg with therapy (P = .0091).
For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> therapy changed the phenotyping measures by a median of -44.4%, 123.5%, and -34.4%, respectively.
We concluded that <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> may cause significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A activity.
This metabolic inhibition may have serious implications for a variety medications.
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> considerably increase serum <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid concentrations.
To study the effects of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase.
A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three phases separated by a washout period of 3 weeks.
Twelve young, healthy volunteers took orally either 1.5 gm/day <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , 240 mg/day <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , or placebo for 2 days.
On day 2, 40 mg <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> was administered orally.
Serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and norverapamil were measured for up to 24 hours.
There was more than tenfold interindividual variability in the extent of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> interaction with both <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
Concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> should be avoided.
As an alternative, the dosage of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> should be reduced considerably, that is, by about 50% to 80%, at least when a <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> dosage higher than 20 mg/day is used.
Possible adverse effects, such as elevation of <START:DRUG> creatine <END> kinase level and muscle tenderness, should be closely monitored when such combinations are used.
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> increased mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.05) and the area under the serum <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] 6.2-fold(p < 0.001) and 4.6-fold (p < 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> increased the mean Cmax of active <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid fivefold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 3.9-fold (p < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> increased the Cmax of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 2.8-fold (p < 0.001).
Both <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> interact considerably with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , probably by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> induces <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> metabolism in human beings.
This study investigated whether time-dependent <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> pharmacokinetics correlated to CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 activity in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> (two oral doses per day of 250 mg) was given to nine healthy Vietnamese subjects for 7 days (day 1 to day 7).
Single 20 mg doses of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> were given orally on day -7, day 1, and day 7.
Single doses of <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> were given in combination on day 14 after a 6-day washout period.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> , <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , hydroxyomeprazole, and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfone were evaluated on days -7, 1, 7, and 14.
On the same days urine was collected for the determination of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> excretion.
Areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) for <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> decreased on day 7 to 20% (95% confidence intervals, 13%, 28%) and 35% (25%, 46%), respectively, compared with values on day 1.
AUC ratios for hydroxyomeprazole/ <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> increased 2.2-fold (1.7, 2.7) on day 7 compared with values on day 1.
All values were normalized at day 14.
There were no significant changes in the <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfone/ <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> ratio or in the 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> ratio between the study days.
In one subject found to have poor CYP2C19 metabolization, the elimination of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> increased after <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> exposure, with no change in the hydroxyomeprazole/ <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> AUC ratio.
 <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> did not alter CYP3A4 activity, whereas an increase in CYP2C19 activity was observed.
The increased elimination of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> in both poor and extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers suggests <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> induces both CYP2C19 and another enzyme.
Different effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
The effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , two inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase with different pharmacokinetic properties, were studied.
Two separate randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over studies, each involving 10 healthy volunteers, were carried out.
The general design was identical in both studies.
The subjects took either 100 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4, 40 mg <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> or 40 mg <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> was administered orally.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and hydroxyitraconazole were determined up to 24 h.
"
The t1/2,z of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> averaged 3.7 +/- 3.8 h and that of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid 4.7 +/- 4.0 h during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase; these variables could not be determined in all subjects during the placebo phase.
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> should therefore not be used concomitantly with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, or the dosage of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> should be greatly reduced while using a CYP3A4 inhibitor.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> had no significant effect on the Cmax (190 +/- 124 ng ml(-1) vs 197 +/- 189 ng ml(-1) (mean +/- s.d.)) or total AUC (368 +/- 153 ng ml(-1) h vs 324 +/- 155 ng ml(-1) h) of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> compared with placebo.
However, the t1/2,z of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> was slightly prolonged by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (2.8 +/- 0.49 h vs 2.4 +/- 0.51 h; P < 0.05).
The Cmax of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> was increased about 15-fold (P < 0.01) and the total AUC more than 15-fold (P < 0.01) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Similarly, the Cmax and total AUC of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid were increased about 12-fold (95% CI, 5.3 to 17.7-fold; P < 0.01) and 15-fold (95% CI, 4.6 to 26.2-fold; P < 0.01) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , even at a small dosage of 100 mg daily, greatly elevated plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and its active metabolite, <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> concentrations were not significantly increased by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , indicating that <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> has much less potential than <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> for clinically significant interactions with <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and other CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> has an extensive first-pass metabolism, which makes it potentially susceptible to drug interactions.
The aim of this study was to investigate possible interactions of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> with <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, three-phase crossover study, nine healthy volunteers received either 80 mg <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , 60 mg <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> , or placebo orally three times a day.
On day 2, after the fifth dose, 10 mg <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was given orally.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> were determined up to 18 hours, and the effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> were measured up to 8 hours.
The effect of <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> on the AUC(0-infinity) of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than that of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
Side effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> occurred more often (p < 0.05) with <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> than with placebo.
Thus enhanced effects and side effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> are possible when it is used with <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> , or other inhibitors of CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> increased the area under the <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> plasma concentration-time curve [AUC (0-infinity)] 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 5.5-fold (p < 0.001), respectively.
The peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was increased 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.1-fold (p < 0.001) by <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> , respectively.
The elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was not changed by <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
Of the six pharmacodynamic variables, only the subjective overall drug effect of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was significantly increased with <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> (p < 0.05) and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> (p < 0.05).
Both <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> considerably increase plasma <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> concentrations, probably by inhibiting its CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism.
Concentrations and effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> are considerably reduced by <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> .
The effects of <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> , a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, were investigated.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study with two phases, 10 young healthy volunteers took either 600 mg <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> or matched placebo once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, 30 mg <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was administered orally.
Plasma <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> concentrations and effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> were measured up to 10 h.
"
A significant (P<0.05) reduction in the effects of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> was observed in three of the six psychomotor tests employed (postural sway test with eyes closed, subjective drowsiness and overall drug effect) after <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> pretreatment.
 <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> will most likely show a greatly reduced anxiolytic effect when used together with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 such as <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> .
The total area under the plasma <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> concentration-time curve after <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> was 10.4% (95% CI, 6.3-14.5%) of that after placebo (1.64+/-0.35 ng ml(-1) h vs 22.0+/-15.1 ng ml(-1) h (mean+/-s.d.); P< 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> decreased the peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> from 6.6+/-3.7 ng ml(-1) to 0.84+/-0.23 ng ml(-1) (P< 0.01) and the half-life from 2.8+/-0.7 h to 1.3+/-0.5 h (P< 0.01).
The strong interaction between <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> is probably mostly due to enhanced CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> .
Effects of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> or <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on <START:DRUG> losartan <END> pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, E3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound.
Coadministered drugs that inhibit or induce metabolic processes may therefore alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic response of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and E3174.
Ten healthy volunteers were studied to assess the effects of CYP3A4 inhibition and nonspecific P450 enzyme induction on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and E3174.
Subjects completed three 1-week phases separated by 6 days: 50 mg <START:DRUG> losartan <END> every morning, <START:DRUG> losartan <END> plus 500 mg <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> four times a day, and <START:DRUG> losartan <END> plus 300 mg <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) twice a day.
On the eighth day of each phase, serial plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and E3174 were obtained over 32 hours and steady-state pharmacokinetics were determined.
The half-life values of both compounds were decreased by 50% (p < 0.005).
Given the magnitude of the effect, this interaction is likely to be clinically significant.
On the basis of the minimal inhibitory effects observed with <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , CYP3A4 appears to play a minor role in the in vivo metabolism of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> to E3174.
Further studies are needed to define the contribution of other isozymes, particularly CYP2C9, to the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and E3174.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> decreased the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours after the dose (AUC [0-24]) of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> by 35% (349 +/- 246 versus 225 +/- 130; p = 0.0001) and decreased the AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 40% (1336 +/- 445 versus 792 +/- 302; p < 0.005).
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> oral clearance was increased by 44% (p = 0.0001).
In contrast, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> did not significantly affect the AUC(0-24) or half-life of either <START:DRUG> losartan <END> or E3174.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> is a potent inducer of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and E3174 elimination.
 <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> but not <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> is very susceptible to interaction with the CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A' (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations.
We studied possible interactions of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> .
Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> (study I) and one with <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (study II).
In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> (study I) or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (study II).
Serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and hydroxyitraconazole were determined.
The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of total <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid (naive <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid plus that derived by hydrolysis of the lactone) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05).
The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001).
The t1/2 was not altered.
The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
There were no differences in the serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and hydroxyitraconazole between studies I and II.
Concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> should be avoided or its dosage should be greatly reduced.
In study I, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid at least tenfold (p < 0.001).
In study II, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> , but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> greatly increased serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism, but it had only a minor effect on <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
The effect of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> , an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> was examined in a double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases.
Seven healthy male subjects took <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> 300 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 10 days, and on the 8th day they took a single oral 0.8 mg dose of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
Blood samples were taken and psychomotor function was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale, and UKU Side Effect Rating Scale up to 48 h after <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> dosing.
The majority of psychomotor function parameters during the <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> treatment were not significantly different from those during the placebo treatment, probably because of the sedative effect of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> itself.
It also supports the previous studies, suggesting that <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> significantly (p < .01 to .001) decreased the plasma <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> concentrations during the elimination phase.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> significantly (p < .001) increased the apparent oral clearance (0.90 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.54 ml/min/kg) and shortened the elimination half-life (17.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.7 h), with no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (11.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 13.0 +/- 3.5 ng/ml).
The present study suggests that <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> decreases plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> by inducing its metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> decreases renal clearance of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> strongly interacts with some drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, for example, <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , by inhibiting their metabolism.
A concomitant use of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increases the serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> , although <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> is excreted mainly unchanged in urine.
To reveal the mechanism of the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> - <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> interaction, the effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the serum concentrations and urinary excretion of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> was studied.
Ten healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
On day 3, each volunteer ingested a single 0.5-mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> .
The serum concentrations of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> and its excretion into urine as well as plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> were determined up to 72 hours after dosing.
The decreased renal clearance of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase partially explains increased concentrations of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> during their concomitant use and may be caused by the inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> secretion in the renal tubular cells.
The mean area under the serum <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> concentration-time curve, AUC(0-72), was approximately 50% higher (P < 0.001) during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase than during the placebo phase.
In addition, the renal clearance of <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> decreased about 20% (P < 0.01) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The increases in <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> Cmax and t(1/2) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> were not statistically significant.
Enhanced effect of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> with <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
 <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> , a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, is metabolized by CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> is an inhibitor of this isozyme.
The aim of this study was to determine if <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> affects plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> in humans.
We investigated the interaction between <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> in a randomized, three-phase crossover study.
Seven healthy male volunteers received orally either a single 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> , a 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> after a 3-day treatment of <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> (180 mg day-1), or a placebo.
Plasma samples were collected to determine <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration over a 24 h period.
The pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> were investigated using the peak saccadic velocity of eye movements (PSV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual analogue scale (VAS) through 8 h.
"
The PSV, EEG, and VAS of the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> plus <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> group revealed significant differences from the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> alone group or the control placebo group.
Inhibition of CYP3A isozyme by <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction.
Therefore, <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> should be avoided when patients are using <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> pretreatment significantly increased the area under the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration-time curve (8.0 +/- 2.4 to 18.2 +/- 3.1 ng ml-1 h; P < 0.001; mean +/- s.d.).
Peak <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration was increased (2.1 +/- 0.7 to 3.6 +/- 1.0 ng ml-1, P < 0.05) and the elimination half-life prolonged (4.1 +/- 2.1 to 7.6 +/- 1.9 h; P < 0.01).
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and increases the intensity of its sedative effects.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> greatly increases plasma concentrations and effects of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> , a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> strongly interacts with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> ); hence it is important to uncover the possible interaction of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> with <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> .
A double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover design was used to investigate the interaction between <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Nine healthy volunteers received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 5 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> were determined and systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were measured up to 32 hours.
In seven of the nine subjects, even the Cmax of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> was lower without <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> than the 32-hour concentrations during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase.
The decreases in blood pressure and the increases in heart rate were significantly greater during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase than during the placebo phase.
The inhibition of CYP3A4 during the first-pass and elimination phases of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> seems to be the mechanism of the observed interaction.
The concomitant use of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and some other azole antifungals with <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> and other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should be avoided or their doses should be reduced accordingly.
On average, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> nearly eightfold (p < 0.001), the areas under the <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> concentration-time curve [AUC(0-32) and AUC(0-infinity)] about sixfold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life twofold (p < 0.05).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> greatly increases plasma concentrations and effects of oral <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> in healthy subjects.
The aim of the study was to characterize further the role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants.
The effect of oral <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (200 mg day-1 for 14 days) on the kinetics of a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> (100 mg) and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (100 mg) was evaluated in two groups of six healthy male subjects.
In the subjects given <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , no significant changes in <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> and 2-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> kinetics were observed during <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> treatment.
This interaction, confirms that CYP3A4 plays a role in the demethylation of tricyclic antidepressants.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> administration was associated with a decrease in <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> apparent oral clearance (from 1.16 +/- 0.21 to 0.96 +/- 0.20 l h-1 kg-1, mean +/- s.d.; P < 0.02), a prolongation in <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> half-life (from 16.7 +/- 3.3 to 19.2 +/- 5.4 h, P < 0.05) and a decrease in area under the curve of metabolically derived <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (from 3507 +/- 1707 to 3180 +/- 1505 nmol l-1 h, P < 0.05), whereas concentrations of 2-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> were unaffected.
These findings indicate that <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a relatively specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> without affecting the 2-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
A study of the potential effect of <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> on the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> .
The effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> 200 mg/day on the metabolism of intravenously administered <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> was examined in a randomised nonblinded parallel-group study in 25 healthy male volunteers.
The terminal elimination rate constant was also significantly reduced, corresponding to the increase in the terminal elimination half-life (from 6.9 to 8.6 hours).
The decrease in clearance was not associated with any significant changes in plasma protein binding or in the apparent volume of distribution of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> .
There was a small but statistically significant decrease (16%) in the clearance of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> in patients receiving the maximum recommended dosage of <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> .
This suggests that the change in <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> clearance may be due to a slight inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP2C9/10 when <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> was administered in its maximum recommended dosage.
However, the small changes in the volume of distribution and plasma binding of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> after <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> treatment indicate that there is a minimal interaction between <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> .
Effect of route of administration of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on the interaction between <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme.
Orally ingested azole antimycotics, including <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , interfere with the metabolism of oral <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> during its absorption and elimination phases.
We compared the effect of oral and intravenous <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally ingested <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> .
A double-dummy, randomized, cross-over study in three phases was performed in 9 healthy volunteers.
The subjects were given orally <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> 400 mg and intravenously saline within 60 min; orally placebo and intravenously <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> 400 mg; and orally placebo and intravenously saline.
An oral dose of 7.5 mg <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was ingested 60 min after oral intake of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> /placebo, i.e. at the end of the corresponding infusion.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , alpha-hydroxymidazolam and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h.
"
We conclude that the metabolism of orally administered <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was more strongly inhibited by oral than by intravenous administration of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
Both oral and intravenous <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> significantly increased the area under the <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-3, AUC0-17) 2- to 3-fold, the elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 2.5-fold and its peak concentration (Cmax) 2- to 2.5-fold compared with placebo.
The AUC0-3 and the Cmax of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> were significantly higher after oral than after intravenous administration of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
Both oral and intravenous <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> increased the pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> but no differences were detected between the <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> phases.
The <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> - <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> interaction.
Evidence for induction of gut wall metabolism.
The calcium channel blocker <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, which is present in liver and mucosa of the small bowel.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 is inducible by the tuberculostatic <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> in liver and the small bowel.
The contribution of gut wall metabolism to total clearance of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> before and during induction has not been determined in detail.
We therefore investigated the <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> - <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> interaction, with special emphasis on the contribution of gut wall metabolism to total metabolism of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> before and during administration of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> were studied in six healthy volunteers on separate days by administration of 20 micrograms/kg body weight <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> iv and 20 mg <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> orally before and after 7 days of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment (600 mg/day).
Enzyme induction did not significantly alter pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> after iv administration.
We conclude that there is a relevant interaction between <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
The reduction of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> bioavailability during enzyme induction is most likely due to <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> -induced gut wall metabolism.
In contrast, oral clearance of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 liters/min to 20.9 +/- 8.3 liters/min (p < 0.01) and bioavailability decreased from 41.2 +/- 5.4% to 5.3 +/- 2.7% (p < 0.001).
Although hepatic extraction of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> was not significantly altered during induction (47.4 +/- 6.6% versus 67.4 +/- 20.2%; ns), the calculated extraction of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> in gut wall mucosa increased from 21.8 +/- 13.3% to 75.8 +/- 28.2% (p < 0.05).
Differential induction of prehepatic and hepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which metabolize numerous drugs, are expressed both in liver and in extrahepatic tissues.
CYP3A4 for example is present and inducible by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract.
It has been shown that such prehepatic metabolism contributes substantially to total clearance of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> ) before and even more pronounced during enzyme induction.
We examined the effect of enzyme induction on prehepatic and hepatic metabolism of the model compound R/S- <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> after simultaneous oral and intravenous administration using a stable isotope technology.
This approach allows us to exclude intraindividual day-to-day variability and is therefore suitable to quantitatively assess prehepatic extraction of high-clearance drugs.
Moreover, because <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> is administered as a race-mate with the S-enantiomer being preferentially metabolized, we investigated the influence of induction on stereoselectivity of prehepatic and hepatic metabolism.
Eight male volunteers received 120 mg of racemic <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> bid for 24 days.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (600 mg daily) was given from day 5 to day 16.
Systemic clearance and bioavailability of the <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> enantiomers were determined by coadministering deuterated <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> intravenously on day 4, on day 16, and on day 24.
Effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> on atrioventricular conduction after oral and intravenous (iv) administration were assessed by measuring the maximum PR-interval prolongation <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> increased the systemic clearance of the active S- <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> 1.3-fold (P < .001).
With <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , the effect of oral <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> on atrioventricular conduction was nearly abolished (P < .01), whereas no significant changes were observed after intravenous administration.
Induction caused a considerable reduction of stereoselectivity after both intravenous and oral administration (P < .001).
These data clearly indicate that prehepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> (presumably in the gut wall) is preferentially induced compared with hepatic metabolism and that stereoselectivity of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> metabolism is affected by induction.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> increased the apparent oral clearance of S- <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> 32-fold (P < .001) and decreased its bioavailability 25-fold (P < .001), with partial recovery after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> withdrawal (P < .01).
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> altered the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacological effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> to a much greater extent after oral administration compared with intravenous administration.
Pharmacogenetic determination of the effects of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> and prediction of drug interactions.
To define the differences in <START:DRUG> codeine <END> pharmacodynamics in extensive (EMs) and poor (PMs) metabolizers of debrisoquin and to determine whether the inhibition of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> 's metabolism by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> produces phenotypically dependent pharmacodynamic changes, we studied 16 healthy nonsmoking males, 10 EMs and 6 PMs of debrisoquin.
The subjects received in random double-blind fashion 120 mg of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> plus placebo, 120 mg of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> plus 100 mg of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and 100 mg of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> plus placebo.
Blood was obtained over 24 hr and urine was collected for 48 hr.
Respiratory, psychomotor and pupillary effects of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> were greater in the EMs than in the PMs (P < .01).
 <START:DRUG> morphine <END> and <START:DRUG> morphine <END> metabolites were detectable only in plasma from EMs.
 <START:DRUG> codeine <END> metabolic clearance by O-demethylation was almost 200-fold greater in the EMs than in the PMs.
After coadministration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , <START:DRUG> morphine <END> and <START:DRUG> morphine <END> metabolites were not detectable in the plasma of either phenotype and mean (+/- S.E.M.) O-demethylation clearance was reduced in the EMs from 162.7 +/- 36.6 to 17.0 +/- 5.0 ml/min (P < .003), but not in the PMs.
The diminished production of <START:DRUG> morphine <END> in the EMs was associated with significantly reduced respiratory, psychomotor and pupillary effects (P < .01).
Thus, CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> to <START:DRUG> morphine <END> is central to its pharmacodynamic effects.
Patients who lack CYP2D6 or whose CYP2D6 is inhibited would not be expected to benefit from <START:DRUG> codeine <END> .
Thus, phenotyping for CYP2D6 and the avoidance of CYP2D6 inhibitors is justified in patients with chronic path before initiating long-term therapy with analgesics whose in vivo activation is dependent on CYP2D6 activity (i.e., <START:DRUG> codeine <END> , <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> and <START:DRUG> oxycodone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> drastically increases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid.
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> is a <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> -lowering drug that can cause myopathy as a rare side effect.
Concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> ) increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity.
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Because <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between these drugs.
In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , hydroxyitraconazole, and <START:DRUG> creatine <END> kinase were measured up to 24 hours.
The mean Cmax of the active metabolite, <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid, was increased 13-fold (range, tenfold to 23-fold; p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) twentyfold (p < 0.001).
No increase in <START:DRUG> creatine <END> kinase was observed in the other subjects.
Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism probably explains the increased toxicity of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> caused not only by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> but also by <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , and other inhibitors of CYP3A4.
Their concomitant use with <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> should be avoided, or the dose of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.
On average, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the peak concentration (Cmax) of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and the area under the <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> concentration-time curve (AUC) more than twentyfold (p < 0.001).
In one subject plasma <START:DRUG> creatine <END> kinase was increased tenfold within 24 hours of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> administration during the <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phase but not during the placebo phase.
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> greatly increases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid.
 <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , but not <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> , enhances the effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> by inhibiting its metabolism.
1.
The interaction between <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and two antifungal agents, <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> , was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of three phases.
2.
Twelve healthy young volunteers received 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , 250 mg <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4 they took a single 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
Plasma samples were collected and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h after the intake of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .

6.
Care should be taken when <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> is prescribed to patients using <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
Although the interaction is not as strong as that of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , it is clinically significant.
 <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and probably other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 can be used in normal doses with <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> increased the area under the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration time-curve more than twofold (P < 0.001) and prolonged the elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> nearly twofold (P < 0.001).
The peak concentration of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> was also increased significantly (P < 0.05) by <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> .
During the <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> phase pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> (e.g. digit symbol substitution test, body sway and drowsiness) were enhanced significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with the placebo phase.
 <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> did not change significantly the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> enhances the effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> by inhibiting its metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> is metabolized by CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> is an inhibitor of this isozyme and interacts with <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , another substrate of this enzyme.
Therefore the possible interaction between <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> is worth investigation.
A balanced, randomized, double-blind crossover study design was used, with an interval of 2 weeks between phases.
Ten healthy volunteers were given 60 mg <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> orally or placebo three times a day for 2 days.
On the second day they received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> , after which plasma samples were collected and effects of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> measured for up to 17 hours.
The increased concentrations of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> during the <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> phase were associated with increased and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects.
Prescription of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> should be avoided if a patient is using <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> increased the mean area under the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration-time curve threefold (p < 0.001) and the elimination half-life (p < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> twofold (p < 0.005).
 <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> has a clinically significant interaction with oral <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
The data is highly suggestive that <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> inhibits the metabolism of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> during the first-pass and elimination phases.
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism via cytochrome P4502D6 in ethnic populations.
The objective of this study was to determine whether metabolism via cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) was higher in Black subjects than White subjects.
Ten Black and 10 White healthy male volunteers who were phenotyped CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotypes participated in this randomized, cross-over study in which <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> was used as a model CYP2D6 substrate.
In both study phases, subjects received oral rac- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> tartrate (200 mg); during one phase, subjects also took <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> sulfate (100 mg) daily beginning 3 days before the dose of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> .
Plasma samples were collected for 12 and 24 hr after the dose in the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> and <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> plus <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> phases, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> enantiomer concentrations were determined by chiral HPLC with fluorescence detection.
S- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> areas under the concentration vs. time curves during the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> phase were 879 +/- 600 ng/ml*hr in White subjects vs. 984 +/- 653 ng/ml*hr in Black subjects.
During inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated metabolism with <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , S- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> areas under the concentration vs. time curves were 2515 +/- 749 and 2719 +/- 742 in White and Black subjects, respectively.
Mean S- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> /R- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> ratios were 1.39 in both racial groups during the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> phase, and during the <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> plus <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> phase were 0.89 and 1.03 in White subjects and Black subjects, respectively (p < 0.05, Blacks vs. Whites).
The percentage of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> was similar between Blacks and Whites (e.g., 66 +/- 15% and 64 +/- 25% of S- <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> apparent oral clearance in Blacks and Whites, respectively).
We conclude that there are no differences between Black subjects and White subjects in metabolism via CYP2D6.
There were also no racial differences in the contribution of CYP2D6 to overall <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> metabolism.
The results of this study suggest that drugs are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 will not exhibit racial differences in their disposition.
 <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> elimination half-lives in both groups were approximately doubled by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
Oral <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> is potentially hazardous to patients receiving systemic antimycotics <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> is metabolized by CYP3A4 isozyme.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> may seriously interact with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> ); hence their possible interaction with <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> in humans is important to uncover.
In this double-blind, randomized, three-phase crossover study, the interaction between <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> was investigated.
Nine healthy young volunteers received either 400 mg <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , or matched placebo (control phase) orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 0.25 mg dose of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and antimycotics were determined, and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours.
In seven of the nine subjects, even the maximum concentration of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> in plasma was lower without the antimycotics than were the 17-hour concentrations during the <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> phases.
All pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test) revealed a significant difference between the antimycotic and placebo phases.
Inhibition of CYP3A4 during the absorption and elimination phases of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> seems to explain the interaction observed.
Because of the potentially hazardous consequences of this interaction, <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> should be avoided if patients are using <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
On average, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the area under the <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 22-fold and 27-fold (p < 0.001), the peak concentrations threefold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life sixfold and sevenfold (p < 0.001), respectively.
Both <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> seriously affect the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> and increase the intensity and duration of its effects.
CYP2D6 phenotype determines the metabolic conversion of <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> to <START:DRUG> hydromorphone <END> .
The contribution of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to the formation of <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> 's active metabolite, <START:DRUG> hydromorphone <END> , was examined in vitro and in vivo.
Human liver microsomes prepared from an individual homozygous for the D6-B mutation of the CYP2D6 gene catalyzed this reaction at a negligible rate.
Urinary metabolic ratios of <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> / <START:DRUG> hydromorphone <END> were highly correlated with O-demethylation ratios for <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , an established marker drug of CYP2D6 activity (rs = 0.85; n = 18).
The kinetics of <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> after a single oral dose and its partial metabolic clearance to <START:DRUG> hydromorphone <END> were investigated in five extensive metabolizers of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , six poor metabolizers, and four extensive metabolizers after pretreatment with <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity.
The mean values for partial metabolic clearance by O-demethylation in the three groups were 28.1 +/- 10.3, 3.4 +/- 2.4, and 5.0 +/- 3.6 ml/hr/kg, respectively.
No statistically significant phenotypic differences in physiologic measures were observed.
However, over the first hour after dosing, the extensive metabolizers reported more \"good opiate effects\" and fewer \"bad opiate effects\" than poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers in whom CYP2D6 was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
These data establish the importance of CYP2D6 in the formation of <START:DRUG> hydromorphone <END> from <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> and suggest that the activity of this enzyme may limit the abuse liability of <START:DRUG> hydrocodone <END> .
Single-dose <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> inhibition of <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> metabolism: a clinical probe for P450 2E1.
 <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> and its reduced metabolite <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> have been identified previously as selective mechanism-based inhibitors of human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2E1 in vitro.
In animals, a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> has been shown to produce a rapid and selective inactivation of hepatic P450 2E1 content and catalytic activity in vivo.
This investigation explored the efficacy of single dose <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> as an inhibitor of human P450 2E1 activity in vivo.
Clinical P450 2E1 activity was assessed by the 6-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , a metabolic pathway catalyzed selectively by P450 2E1.
Six healthy volunteers received 750 mg oral <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> on two occasions in a crossover design, 10 hours after 500 mg oral <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> , or after no pretreatment (control subjects).
These findings show that a single dose of <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> significantly diminishes the activity of human P450 2E1 in vivo.
The efficacy of single-dose <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> as an inhibitor of human P450 2E1 suggests that this modality for manipulating clinical P450 2E1 activity may provide a useful probe for delineating P450 2E1 participation in human drug biotransformation or for the treatment of poisoning by P450 2E1-activated toxins.
 <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> pretreatment markedly decreased <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> elimination clearance to 15% of control values (from 3.28 +/- 1.40 to 0.49 +/- 0.07 ml/kg/min, p < 0.005), prolonged the elimination half-life (from 0.92 +/- 0.32 to 5.1 +/- 0.9 hours, p < 0.001), and caused a twofold increase in peak plasma <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> concentrations (20.6 +/- 9.9 versus 38.7 +/- 10.3 micrograms/ml, p < 0.001).
 <START:DRUG> disulfiram <END> also profoundly decreased the formation clearance of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone, from 2.30 +/- 0.93 to 0.17 +/- 0.05 ml/kg/min (p < 0.005).
Effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> in healthy subjects.
The effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (100 mg/day for 10 consecutive days) on the kinetics of a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> (50 mg) and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (100 mg) was investigated in 12 healthy subjects.
Compared with a control session, treatment with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> caused a significant prolongation of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> half-life (from 22.8 +/- 6.4 to 40.5 +/- 5.0 h, means +/- SD, p < 0.01) and a marked decrease in <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> apparent oral clearance (from 1.02 +/- 0.19 to 0.28 +/- 0.06 L/h/kg, p < 0.0001).
No significant changes in <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> kinetics were observed during <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> treatment.
These findings indicate that, at the dosage tested, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> markedly inhibits the demethylation of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> without affecting significantly the CYP2D6-mediated hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> : interaction studies with <START:DRUG> levomepromazine <END> , <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , and <START:DRUG> lithium <END> .
The pharmacokinetic interactions between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> , given as an oral dose of 40 mg/day for 10 days, and (1) <START:DRUG> levomepromazine <END> (50 mg single oral dose), (2) <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> (100 mg single oral dose), and (3) <START:DRUG> lithium <END> (30 mmol/day orally for 5 days) were examined in three panels each of 8 healthy young male volunteers (age 20-31).
All volunteers were classified as extensive metabolizers of sparteine and <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> .
Each subject completed three study phases--one with <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> alone, one with one of the three other drugs, alone, and one with <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> combined with the corresponding other drug.
For <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> and its metabolites, a non-enantioselective analytical method (high-performance liquid chromatography) was used.
Only two statistically significant interactions were indicated.
These findings are in agreement with the recent observations that (1) the demethylation of desmethylcitalopram (to didesmethylcytalopram) is partly mediated via the sparteine/ <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> oxygenase (CYP2D6) and that <START:DRUG> levomepromazine <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and (2) that desmethylcitalopram has a somewhat stronger affinity for CYP2D6 than <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , and therefore may inhibit the hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , which is also a substrate of CYP2D6.
First, <START:DRUG> levomepromazine <END> caused a 10-20% increase from the initial steady-state levels of the primary <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> metabolite, desmethylcitalopram.
Second, <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> caused approximately 50% increase in the single-dose area under the serum concentration/time curve of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (primary metabolite or <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> ) and a corresponding reduction in the level of the subsequently formed metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine.
 <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> - <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> interaction in a heart transplant patient.
This interaction necessitated a significant dosage reduction to maintain <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> concentrations within the therapeutic range.
To investigate the mechanism of the interaction, a <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> -lipoprotein-binding determination was performed.
The results suggest that drug displacement from competitive lipoprotein-binding sites is not responsible for the alterations in <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> pharmacokinetics.
clearance data suggests, however, that the primary mechanism for the interaction is the inhibition <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> metabolism by the cytochrome P-450 system.
This report emphasizes the importance of reevaluating therapeutic drug regimens when new agents are added to prevent complications caused by drug interactions.
If <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> and <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> must be used concomitantly, <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> levels must be monitored frequently, in anticipation of this interaction.
We report the case of a heart transplant patient whose <START:DRUG> cyclosporine <END> clearance decreased by more than 50% after the institution of <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> therapy.
Stereoselective genetically-determined interaction between chronic <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> in patients with arrhythmias.
1.
Recent reports have indicated a role for the P450IID6 polymorphism in the stereoselective disposition of single doses of the antiarrhythmic <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> .
2.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of adding low dose <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a potent inhibitor of P450IID6, to chronic <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> therapy in patients with arrhythmias.
3.
This change was attributable to a decrease in metabolic clearance, was accompanied by decreased formation of the two major metabolites of <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> and was not observed in a poor metabolizer subject.
The renal clearance of R-(-)- <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> rose significantly.

The pharmacologic effects of <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> therapy (QRS widening, % arrhythmia suppression) were slightly, but not significantly, increased.
6.
In extensive metabolizer patients receiving chronic <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> , increased plasma concentration will develop if P450IID6 is inhibited.
In five extensive metabolizer patients, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> significantly reduced the clearance of R-(-)- <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> , from 395 +/- 121 (s.d.) to 335 +/- 88 ml min-1.
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> did not alter the clearance of S-(+)- <START:DRUG> flecainide <END> .
Cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in melatonin metabolism in human liver microsomes.
The present study was carried out to identify the cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) involved in the 6-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of melatonin.
The formation kinetics of 6-hydroxymelatonin and N-acetylserotonin were determined using human liver microsomes and cDNA yeast-expressed human enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9 and 2C19) over the substrate concentration range 1-1000 microM.
Selective inhibitors and substrates of various cytochrome P450 enzymes were also employed.
cDNA yeast-expressed CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 catalysed the formation of the two metabolites, confirming the data obtained with specific inhibitors and substrates.
Our results strongly suggest that 6-hydroxylation, the main metabolic pathway of melatonin, is mediated mainly, but not exclusively, by CYP1A2, the high-affinity enzyme involved in melatonin metabolism, confirming the observation that a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> increases nocturnal serum melatonin levels in healthy subjects.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> was a potent inhibitor of 6-hydroxymelatonin formation, giving 50 +/- 5% and 69 +/- 9% inhibition at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM, respectively, after incubation with 50 microM melatonin.
 <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> used at low and high concentrations substantially inhibited both metabolic pathways.
Furthermore, the results indicate that there is a potential for interaction with drugs metabolised by CYP1A2 both at physiological levels and after oral administration of melatonin, while CYP2C19 and CYP2C9are assumed to be less important.
Involvement of human liver cytochrome P4502B6 in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> .
To determine the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms involved in the oxidation of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> by human liver microsomes.
The rate constant calculated from the disappearance of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> in an incubation mixture with human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP isoforms was used as a measure of the rate of metabolism of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> .
The correlation of these rate constants with rates of metabolism of CYP isoform-selective substrates by liver microsomes, the effect of CYP isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies on <START:DRUG> propofol <END> metabolism by liver microsomes, and its metabolism by recombinant human CYP isoforms were examined.
The mean rate constant of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> metabolism by liver microsomes obtained from six individuals was 4.2 (95% confidence intervals 2.7, 5.7) nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein.
The rate constants of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> by microsomes were significantly correlated with <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> N-demethylation, a marker of CYP2B6 (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001), but not with the metabolic activities of other CYP isoform-selective substrates.
Of the recombinant CYP isoforms screened, CYP2B6 produced the highest rate constant for <START:DRUG> propofol <END> metabolism (197 nmol min-1 nmol P450-1).
Antibodies raised against other CYP isoforms had no effect on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> .
CYP2B6 is predominantly involved in the oxidation of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> by human liver microsomes.
Of the chemical inhibitors of CYP isoforms tested, <START:DRUG> orphenadrine <END> , a CYP2B6 inhibitor, reduced the rate constant of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> by liver microsomes by 38% (P < 0.05), while other CYP isoform-selective inhibitors had no effects.
An antibody against CYP2B6 inhibited the disappearance of <START:DRUG> propofol <END> in liver microsomes by 74%.
Identification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
To characterize the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes responsible for the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> to its main metabolite, UK-103 320, to investigate the potential inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on CYP enzymes and to evaluate the potential of selected drugs to affect <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> metabolism.
The metabolic pathways of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> N-demethylation were studied using human liver microsomes, as well as microsomes expressing individual human CYP enzymes.
Further studies to identify the individual enzymes were performed at 2.5 and 250 microM <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> , and employed a combination of chemical inhibition , correlation analysis, and metabolism by expressed recombinant CYP enzymes.
In addition, the effect of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> on the activity of the six major drug metabolizing enzymes was investigated.
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> conversion was found to be mediated by at least two CYP enzymes, for which the mean kinetic parameters were Km1 = 6(+/-3 microM), Km2 = 81(+/-45 microM), Vmax1 = 22(+/-9 pmol) and Vmax2 = 138(+/-77 pmol) UK-103 320 formed min(-1) mg(-1).
At 250 microM <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> , N-demethylation was primarily mediated through the low-affinity, high-Km enzyme (approximately 83%), whilst at 2.5 microM there was a greater role for the high-affinity, low-Km enzyme (approximately 61%).
Overall, 75% or more of the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> at any concentration is probably attributable to CYP3A4.
These results were supported by experiments using expressed human CYP enzymes, in which only CYP3A4 and CYP3A4 exhibited substantial <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> N-demethylase activity (respective Km values of 221 microM and 27 microM).
Since peak plasma concentrations of clinical doses of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> are only 200 ng ml(-1) ( approximately 0.4 microM) it is very unlikely that <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> will significantly alter the plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> strongly inhibited metabolism at both <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> concentrations and was the only significantinhibitor at 250 microM <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
At the lower <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> concentration, <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> also inhibited formation of UK-103 320.
 <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> metabolism was inhibited by potent CYP3A4 inhibitors which are used clinically, but was found to be only a weak inhibitor of drug metabolizing enzymes itself, the strongest inhibition occurring against CYP2C9 (Ki = 80 microM).
Evidence is provided for CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> .
There is the possibility that elevated plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> sildenafil <END> could occur with coadministration of known inhibitors of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> flunitrazepam <END> metabolism by cytochrome P450S 2C19 and 3A4.
We have identified CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 as the principal cytochrome P450s involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> flunitrazepam <END> to its major metabolites <START:DRUG> desmethylflunitrazepam <END> and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam <END> .
Human CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 mediated the formation of <START:DRUG> desmethylflunitrazepam <END> with Km values of 11.1 and 108 microM, respectively, and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam <END> with Km values of 642 and 34.0 microM, respectively.
In human liver microsomes (n = 4) formation of both metabolites followed biphasic kinetics.
Our data also suggest that CYP1A2, -2B6 , -2C8 , -2C9, -2D6 , and -2E1 are not involved in either of these metabolic pathways.
We estimate that the relative contributions of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to the formation of <START:DRUG> desmethylflunitrazepam <END> in vivo are 63 and 37%, respectively, at therapeutic <START:DRUG> flunitrazepam <END> concentrations (0.03 microM).
We conclude that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19 importantly mediates <START:DRUG> flunitrazepam <END> demethylation, which may alter the efficacy and safety of the drug, while CYP3A4 catalyzes the formation of <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam <END> .
 <START:DRUG> desmethylflunitrazepam <END> formation was inhibited 31% by <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> and 78% by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , suggesting involvement of both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 .
Formation of <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam <END> was also significantly inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (94%) and <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> (18%).
In support of these chemical inhibition data, antibodies directed against CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 selectively inhibited formation of <START:DRUG> desmethylflunitrazepam <END> by 26 and 45%, respectively, while anti-CYP3A4 antibodies reduced <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam <END> formation by 80%.
Inhibition of human cytochrome P450 isoforms by nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
The capacity of three clinically available nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to inhibit the activity of human cytochromes P450 (CYPs) was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes.
The in vitro microsomal model provides relevant predictive data on probable drug interactions with NNRTIs when the mechanism is inhibition of CYP-mediated drug biotransformation.
However, the model does not incorporate interactions attributable to enzyme induction.
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> , and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> produced negligible inhibition of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2) or <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6).
 <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> did not inhibit hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (CYP2C9) or <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19) , but these CYP isoforms were importantly inhibited by <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> .
This indicates the likelihood of significantly impaired clearance of CYP2C substrate drugs (such as <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , and <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> ) upon initial exposure to these two NNRTIs.
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (but not <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> ) also were strong inhibitors of CYP3A , consistent with clinical hazards of initial cotreatment with either of these drugs and substrates of CYP3A .
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> , and <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro: potential drug interactions with <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> .
Since antiretroviral drugs are known to inhibit many cytochrome P450 isoforms, the inhibition of CYP2B6 by non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and viral protease inhibitors was studied in vitro in human liver microsomes using <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation as the CYP2B6 index reaction.
Mean IC(50) values (microM) for inhibition of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation were: <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> (2.5), <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (2.2), and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> (5.5).
The reaction was only weakly inhibited by <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> , <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , and <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> .
The inhibition of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation in vitro by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> indicates inhibitory potency versus CYP2B6 and suggests the potential for clinical drug interactions.
Identification of the human cytochrome P450 isoforms mediating in vitro N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> .
To identify the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms mediating the N-dealkylation of the antipsychotic drug <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> in vitro and estimate the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved.
cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> , which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug.
Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction.
Reaction velocities and their relative abundance in HLM suggested that CYP1A2 , 3A4, 2C19 and 2D6 were the most important contributors to N-dealkylation.
Apparent Km values of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 were in the range 1-2 microM, and Km values of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were 14 microM and 7.9 microM, respectively.
HLM-mediated N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> accounted for 57% of the total amount of substrate consumed during incubation.
The present in vitro study suggests that CYP isoforms 1A2 , 3A4, 2C19 and 2CD6 are primarily involved in the N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> .
The relatively modest role of CYP2D6 is at variance with in vivo studies, which indicate a greater contribution of this isoform.
Alternative metabolic pathways, corresponding to 43% of the HLM-mediated metabolism of the drug, may depend more strongly on CYP2D6 .
CYP isoforms 1A2 , 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 were able to mediate the N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that CYP3A4 accounted for about 40% of <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> N-dealkylation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.
The contribution of the CYP isoforms 1A2 , 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25% each as measured by the percentage inhibition obtained by addition of <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> or <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , respectively.
Interaction of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> with human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 : inhibition of CYP2C, CYP2C19 , and CYP2D6 .
It is also an irreversible inhibitor of CYP3A4.
The interaction of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> with CYP2C9 was examined with pooled human liver microsomes using <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation as a reporter of CYP2C9 catalytic activity.
Nonlinear regression analysis revealed an apparent K(i) of 2.6+/-0.4 microM.
There was no evidence for bioactivation as prerequisite to inhibition of CYP2C9 .
Desalkyl <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , the major circulating metabolite of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , had no apparent effect on microsomal CYP2C9 activity at concentrations up to 20 microM.
Several analogs of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> showed similar inhibition of CYP2C9 .
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , a non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, is metabolized primarily through desalkylation catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and by pyridine hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
As <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> concentration was increased from 0 to 100 microM, the K(M) for <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> metabolism rose from 4.5+/-0.5 to 21+/-6 microM, and V(max) declined from 4.2+/-0.1 to 0.54+/-0.08 nmol/min/mg of protein, characteristic of mixed-type inhibition .
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> significantly inhibited cDNA-expressed CYP2C19-catalyzed (S)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation in a noncompetitive manner, with an apparent K(i) of 24+/-3 microM.
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> at concentrations up to 100 microM did not inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 or -2E1 .
 <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> competitively inhibited recombinant CYP2D6 activity with a K(i) of 12.8+/-1.8 microM, similar to the observed K(M) for <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> desalkylation.
These results, along with previously reported experiments, indicate that <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> can partially inhibit CYP2C9 , -2C19 , -2D6 , and -3A4 , although the degree of inhibition in vivo would be subject to a variety of additional factors.
Identification of the human liver cytochrome P450 isoenzyme responsible for the 6-methylhydroxylation of the novel anticancer drug <START:DRUG> 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid <END> .
In vitro studies were conducted to identify the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme involved in the 6-methylhydroxylation of 5, 6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) by using a human liver library (n = 14).
The metabolite 6-hydroxymethyl-5-methylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (6-OH-MXAA) was determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection.
The metabolite formed in human liver microsomes and by cDNA-expressed CYP isoform was identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry as 6-OH-MXAA.
In human liver microsomes (n = 14), 6-methylhydroxylation of DMXAA followed monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a mean apparent K(m) of 21 +/- 5 microM and V(max) of 0.043 +/- 0.019 nmol/min/mg.
An approximate 10-fold interindividual variation in the intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) of DMXAA 6-methylhydroxylation in human liver microsomes was observed.
The involvement of CYP1A2 in DMXAA metabolism by human livers was demonstrated by the following: 1) the potent inhibition of DMXAA metabolism by <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (k(inact) = 0.23 +/- 0.04 min(-1), K'(app) = 15.6 +/- 6.7 microM) and <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> (K(i) = 0.036 microM) , but not by <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> ; 2) when incubated with human lymphoblastoid cell microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP isoenzymes, DMXAA was metabolized only by CYP1A2 , with an apparent K(m) of 6.2 +/- 1.5 microM and V(max) of 0.014 +/- 0.001 nmol/min/mg , but not by CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9(Arg(144)), CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 (Val(374)), CYP2E1 , and CYP3A4 ; 3) a significant correlation (r = 0.90; P <.001) between 6-methylhydroxylation of DMXAA and 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation; and 4) a significant correlation (r = 0.75; P <.01) between the CYP1A protein level determined by Western blots and DMXAA 6-methylhydroxylation.
Effects of macrolide antibiotics on CYP3A expression in human and rat hepatocytes: interspecies differences in response to <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> .
The effects of various macrolide antibiotics [triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) , <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> azithromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> roxithromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> base] and the new ketolide <START:DRUG> hMR3004 <END> on CYP3A expression were evaluated in human and rat hepatocytes.
Cells were treated for 3 days with nontoxic concentrations of the drugs, and CYP3A induction was assessed through <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> hydroxylase activity and Western and Northern blot analyses.
In rat hepatocytes, no induction of CYP3A1 expression was observed following exposure to macrolides, even to <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> base and TAO (well known in vivo CYP3A1 inducers), whereas <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> were confirmed to induce this enzyme.
This result was in agreement with the high amount of CYP3A4 protein and mRNA revealed by Western and Northern blot analyses.
Other tested macrolides had no induction effect on CYP3A expression.
These results confirmed the interspecies variability of CYP3A regulation in hepatocytes and raised the question of its mechanism of induction by macrolides in human liver.
In contrast, treatment of fresh and thawed human hepatocytes with TAO, produced an increase of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> hydroxylation (4-fold over control).
CYP3A4 is a major isoform responsible for oxidation of 7-hydroxy-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol to 7-oxo-delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol in human liver microsomes.
The human liver enzyme microsomal alcohol oxygenase was able to oxidize both 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-THC) to 7-oxo-Delta(8)-THC.
The oxidative activity was determined by using a panel of 12 individual cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) (1A1 , 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9-Arg , 2C9-Cys , 2C19 , 2D6-Met , 2D6-Val, 2E1 and 3A4).
Among the CYP isoforms examined, CYP3A4 showed the highest activity for both of substrates.
The metabolism of 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-THC to 7-oxo-Delta(8)-THC was also detected for CYPs 1A1 (4.8% of CYP3A4 ), 1A2 (4.7%), 2A6 (2.3%), 2C8 (16.6%), and 2C9-Cys (5.4%), and CYPs 1A1 (0.4%), 2C8 (1.3%), 2C9-Arg (4.3%), and 2C9-Cys (0.9%), respectively.
When the substrates were incubated with the CYP3A4-expressed microsomes under oxygen-18 gas phase, atmospheric oxygen was incorporated into 35% of 7-oxo-Delta(8)-THC formed from 7alpha-OH-Delta(8)-THC, but only 12% of 7-oxo-Delta(8)-THC formed from 7beta-OH-Delta(8)-THC.
These results indicate that CYP3A4 is a major isoform responsible for the oxidation of 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-THC to 7-oxo-Delta(8)-THC in liver microsomes of humans, although the oxidation mechanisms for 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-THC might be different.
The 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxy-Delta(8)-THC microsomal alcohol oxygenase activities in human liver were significantly inhibited by addition of 100 microMtroleandomycin , 1 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , and anti-CYP3A antibody, although these activities were not inhibited by 1 microM 7, 8-benzoflavone and 50 microM <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> .
Identification of enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> metabolism in human liver microsomes.
1.
The major metabolites of <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> in human are 25-deacetyl- <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> and 32-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> .
Biotransformation to these metabolites in pooled human liver microsomes, cytosol and supernatant 9000g (S9) fractions was studied, and the enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> metabolism were identified using inhibitors of esterases and cytochromes P450 (CYP) .
2.
The 25-deacetylation and 32-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> occurred in incubations with microsomes or S9 but not with cytosol, indicating that both the enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> metabolism were microsomal.
Km and Vmax of the <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -25-deacetylation in microsomes were 6.5 microM and 11.9 pmol/min/mg with NADPH, and 2.6 microM and 6.0 pmol/min/mg without NADPH, indicating that, although <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -25-deacetylation did not require NADPH, NADPH activated it.
 <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -32-hydroxylation was NADPH dependent, and its Km and Vmax were 3.3 microM and 11.0 pmol/min/mg respectively.
3.
4.
 <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -25-deacetylation in microsomes was completely inhibited by <START:DRUG> diisopropyl fluorophosphate <END> , <START:DRUG> diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate <END> and <START:DRUG> eserine <END> , but not by <START:DRUG> p-chloromercuribenzoate <END> or 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) , indicating that the enzyme responsible for the <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -25-deacetylation is a B-esterase .
 <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -32-hydroxylation in microsomes was completely inhibited by CYP3A4-specific inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> ) and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 such as <START:DRUG> cyclosporin A <END> and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> , indicating that the enzyme responsible for the <START:DRUG> rifalazil <END> -32-hydroxylation is CYP3A4 .
CYP2C8/9 mediate <START:DRUG> dapsone <END> N-hydroxylation at clinical concentrations of <START:DRUG> dapsone <END> .
This activation was cytochrome b5-dependent.
Because CYP2C18 and CYP19 are expressed at low concentrations in the human liver, these observations indicate that at clinical DDS concentrations, CYP2C9 is a major and CYP2C8 is a likely minor contributor to DDS-NHY in human liver microsomes.
Using selective cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors and clinical concentrations (4 microM) of <START:DRUG> dapsone <END> (DDS), we found a major contribution of CYP2C9 and little or no contribution (< or = 10%) of CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 to <START:DRUG> dapsone <END> N-hydroxylation (DDS-NHY) in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (2.16 microM) and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (500 microM), selective inhibitors of CYP2C9 (or 2C8/9) , inhibited DDS-NHY by 48 +/- 14 and 41 +/- 15%, respectively.
The apparent Michaelis-Menten Km values for DDS-NHY by cloned CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C18, and CYP2C19 were 75 microM, 31 microM, 25 microM, and greater than 1 mM, respectively.
CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 were incapable of DDS-NHY at 4 microM DDS.
 <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> (360 microM) activated DDS-NHY by human liver microsomes and by CYP2C8 by 43 +/- 36 and 193 +/- 16%, respectively.
In contrast, <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> inhibited DDS-NHY by CYP2C9 , CYP2C18 , and CYP2C19 by 27 +/- 2, 49 +/- 1, and 32 +/- 4%, respectively.
In vitro inhibition screening of human hepatic P450 enzymes by five angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.
Metabolic interactions at the level of drug-metabolising enzymes are important for drug therapy.
We investigated potential interactions of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> , <START:DRUG> valsartan <END> , <START:DRUG> eprosartan <END> and <START:DRUG> candesartan <END> with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in human liver microsomes.
In incubations with human liver microsomes in vitro, the inhibitory potency of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (sartans) on CYP-specific model activities were compared by measuring the IC50 and, with respect to more potent inhibition , Ki values.
All sartans except <START:DRUG> eprosartan <END> have at least some affinity for CYP2C9 , but only <START:DRUG> losartan <END> has an affinity for CYP2C19 .
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> have modest affinity for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 .
This would suggest that the theoretical potential for drug interactions is likely to be quite low, with the possible exceptions of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> for CYP2C9 .
Based on these findings, further studies on the interaction potential of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> are warranted.
None of the five sartans inhibited CYP2A6 -, CYP2D6 - or CYP2E1-associated activities ( <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation and <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation, respectively) to any significant extent.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> inhibited the CYP2C9-associated <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> methylhydroxylation more potently (Ki values 4.1 microM and 24.5 microM), than <START:DRUG> valsartan <END> , <START:DRUG> candesartan <END> or <START:DRUG> eprosartan <END> (Ki values 135 microM, 155 microM and > 1000 microM, respectively).
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> inhibited CYP1A2- and CYP3A4-associated activities ( <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation) with relatively weak affinities (IC50 values between 200 microM and 500 microM).
CYP2C1OFF <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation activity was inhibited by <START:DRUG> losartan <END> (IC50 value 138 microM) and much less or not at all by the other sartans tested.
Inhibition of human cytochrome P450 isoforms in vitro by <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> .
 <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> is a cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist used to treat allergic and exercise-induced asthma.
This in vitro study used human liver microsomes to evaluate the inhibitory activity of <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> versus six human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms.
 <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> (0-250 microM) was co-incubated with fixed concentrations of index substrates.
 <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> deserves further clinical study as an inhibitor of other CYP2C9 substrates such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and mestranol.
Clinically important inhibition by <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> of other CYP isoforms is not established.
 <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> inhibited the hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (CYP2C9 ; mean IC(50)=7.0 microM), <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> (CYP3A; IC(50)=20.9 microM) and <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19; IC(50)=32.7 microM), and was a less potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2; IC(50)=56 microM) and <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6 ; IC(50)=116 microM).
 <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> produced negligible inhibition of CYP2E1 .
In vitro inhibition of CYP2C9 by <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> is consistent with clinical studies showing impaired clearance of S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> and enhanced anti-thrombotic effects, although the in vitro IC(50) value is higher than the usual range of clinically relevant plasma concentrations.
Interaction of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> with the human cytochrome P450 system: metabolism and inhibition studies.
Using human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) , we characterized the CYP450 isoforms involved in the primary metabolic pathways of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> and documented the ability of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> to inhibit the CYP450 system.
In HLMs, <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> was N-dealkylated to <START:DRUG> norcisapride <END> (NORCIS) and hydroxylated to <START:DRUG> 3-fluoro-4-hydroxycisapride <END> (3-F-4-OHCIS) and to <START:DRUG> 4-fluoro-2-hydroxycisapride <END> (4-F-2-OHCIS).
Formation of NORCIS, 3-F-4-OHCIS, and 4-F-2-OHCIS in HLMs exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m): 23.4 +/- 8.6, 32 +/- 11, and 31 +/- 23 microM; V(max): 155 +/- 91, 52 +/- 23, and 31 +/- 23 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively).
The average in vitro intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) revealed that the formation of NORCIS was 3.9- to 5.
9-fold higher than that of the two hydroxylated metabolites.
Of 10 recombinant human CYP450s tested, CYP3A4 formed NORCIS from 10 microM <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> at the highest rate (V = 0.56 +/- 0.13 pmol/min/pmol of P450) followed by CYP2C8 (V = 0.29 +/- 0.08 pmol/min/pmol of P450) and CYP2B6 (0.15 +/- 0.04 pmol/min/pmol of P450).
The formation of 3-F-4-OHCIS was mainly catalyzed by CYP2C8 (V = 0.71 +/- 0.24 pmol/min/pmol of P450) and that of 4-F-2-OHCIS by CYP3A4 (0.16 +/- 0.03 pmol/min/pmol of P450 ).
Clearly, recombinant CYP2C8 participates in <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> metabolism, but when the in vitro intrinsic clearances obtained were corrected for abundance of each CYP450 in the liver, CYP3A4 is the dominant isoform.
Our data suggest that CYP3A is the main isoform involved in the overall metabolic clearance of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> .
 <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> metabolism is likely to be subject to interindividual variability in CYP3A expression and to drug interactions involving this isoform.
Formation rate of NORCIS from 10 microM <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> in 14 HLMs was highly variable (range, 4.9-133.6 pmol/min/mg of protein) and significantly correlated with the activities of CYP3A (r = 0.86, P =.0001),CYP2C19 , and 1A2 .
Of isoform-specific inhibitors, 1 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and 50 microM <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> were potent inhibitors of NORCIS formation from 10 microM <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> (by 51 +/- 9 and 44 +/- 17%, respectively), whereas the effect of other inhibitors was minimal.
 <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> was a relatively potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , with no significant effect on other isoforms tested, but the K(i) value derived (14 +/- 16 microM) was much higher than the clinically expected concentration of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> (<1 microM).
Lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies on the effects of <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> and <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> hydroxylation.
 <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> is a flavonoid that stimulates the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is found in high levels in <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> .
The effect of <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> on hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , a CYP3A4 probe, was examined in vitro with human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP3A4.
In addition, the effect of <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (15 mg) and its active 1'-hydroxymetabolite was studied in a randomized crossover study in eight healthy volunteers.
These findings are consistent with a small delay in the absorption of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and lack of effect on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation.
However, <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on CYP3A4 in humans.
Further studies are required to assess whether in vitro stimulators of CYP3A4 can influence drug metabolism in vivo.
In microsomes from three human livers, <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> (1 to 100 micromol/L) increased <START:DRUG> 1'-hydroxymidazolam <END> formation (12.5 micromol/L <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ) by up to 212%.
In complementary deoxyribonucleic acid-expressed CYP3A4 , a 52% stimulation of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation was reached at 50 micromol/L <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> with no effect on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 4-hydroxylation.
In the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 200 mL <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> reduced the area under the concentration versus time curve to 1.5 hours [AUC(O-1.5h)] of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> 1'-hydroxymidazolam <END> by 39% and 46%, respectively, and prolonged the time to reach peak concentration (P < .05) without affecting the total AUC values, elimination half-life values, or AUC ratios ( <START:DRUG> 1'-hydroxymidazolam <END> / <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ).
Accordingly, <START:DRUG> tangerine juice <END> slightly postponed the maximum pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (P < .05).
 <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> is a potent regioselective stimulator of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation by human liver microsomes and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid-expressed CYP3A4.
Human cytochrome P-450 3A4: in vitro drug-drug interaction patterns are substrate-dependent.
 <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , and <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> , four commonly used substrates for human cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), were studied in pairs in human liver microsomes and in microsomes from cells containing recombinant human CYP3A4 and P-450 reductase, to investigate in vitro substrate-substrate interaction with CYP3A4 .
The interaction patterns between compounds with CYP3A4 were found to be substrate-dependent.
Furthermore, the effect of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> 7,8-benzoflavone <END> on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation demonstrated different regiospecificities.
These results may be explained by a model in which multiple substrates or ligands can bind concurrently to the active site of a single CYP3A4 molecule.
However, the contribution of separate allosteric sites and conformational heterogeneity to the atypical kinetics of CYP3A4 can not be ruled out in this model.
Mutual inhibition, partial inhibition, and activation were observed in the <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> - <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> - <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , or <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> - <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> interactions.
However, the most unusual result was the interaction between <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> .
Although <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> inhibited <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner, <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> did not inhibit <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation.
Drug interactions with calcium channel blockers: possible involvement of metabolite-intermediate complexation with CYP3A .
The inhibitory effects of six commonly used calcium channel blockers on three major cytochrome P-450 activities were examined and characterized in human liver microsomes.
The IC(50) values for the inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 for <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> were 3 to 9 microM, whereas those for all others ranged from 14 to >150 microM.
Similar results also were obtained based on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylase activity.
Unlike the observations with <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , a potent irreversible inhibitor of CYP3A , the NADPH-dependent inhibition of CYP3A activity by <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> was completely reversible on dialysis, whereas that by <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> was partially restored (80%).
Additional experiments revealed that <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> formed cytochrome P-450-iron (II) -metabolite complex in both human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> yielded a higher extent of complex formation ( approximately 30% at 100 microM), and was a much faster-acting inhibitor (maximal inhibition rate constant approximately 2 min(-1)) as compared with <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
These present findings that the CYP3A inhibition caused by <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> is, at least in part, quasi-irreversible provide a rational basis for pharmacokinetically significant interactions reported when they were coadministered with agents that are cleared primarily by CYP3A-mediated pathways.
All six compounds reversibly inhibited CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation) and CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> methyl hydroxylation) activities.
Except for <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> , all calcium channel blockers showed increased inhibitory potency toward CYP3A activities ( <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation) after 30-min preincubation with NADPH.
IC(50) values for the inhibition of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase obtained in the NADPH-preincubation experiment for <START:DRUG> nicardipine <END> (1 microM), <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> (2 microM), and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> (5 microM) were within 10-fold, whereas those for <START:DRUG> amlodipine <END> (5 microM) and <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> (13 microM) were >200-fold of their respective plasma concentrations reported after therapeutic doses.
Inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> on cytochrome P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> , an atropine derivative used for the treatment of urge incontinence, was tested for inhibitory effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes.
Metabolic activities were determined in liver microsomes from two donors using the following selective substrates: <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> (CYP2D6) , <START:DRUG> denitronifedipine <END> (CYP3A4) , <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (CYP1A2) , <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CYP2E1) , <START:DRUG> s-(+)-mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19) , S-(-)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> (CYP2C9) and <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> (CYP2A6).
Incubations with each substrate were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> at varying concentrations (37-3000 microM) at 37 degrees in 0.1 M KH2PO4 buffer containing up to 3% DMSO.
Metabolite concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in all cases except CYP2A6 where direct fluorescence spectroscopy was used.
First, <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> IC50 values were determined for each substrate at respective K(M) concentrations.
Therefore, additional <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> concentrations (0.4-2000 microM) were tested.
Compared to therapeutic <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> peak plasma concentrations below 50 nM, the 1000-times higher competitive inhibition constant Ki however suggests that inhibition of CYP2D6 by <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> is without any clinical relevance.
 <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> did not show relevant inhibitory effects on the metabolism of most substrates (IC50 values considerably higher than 1 mM).
The only clear inhibition was seen for the CYP2D6-dependent high-affinity O-demethylation of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , where IC50 values of 27 microM and 44 microM were observed.
 <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction with Ki values of 20 and 51 microM, respectively.
Thus, <START:DRUG> trospium chloride <END> has negligible inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 , CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 activity but is a reasonably potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> is a more potent inhibitor of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> metabolism than <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> in vitro.
CYP3A4 is generally believed to be the major CYP enzyme involved in the biotransformation of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> in man; however, recent in vivo studies suggest that this may not be the case.
We have examined the effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitors <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and the CYP1A2 inhibitor <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> on the N-deethylation, i.e. formation of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), and 3-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> by human liver microsomes.
The experiments were carried out at <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> concentrations of 5 microM (clinically relevant concentration) and 800 microM.
The formation of both MEGX and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxylidocaine <END> was best described by a two-enzyme model.
At 5 microM of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> was a potent inhibitor of the formation of MEGX (IC50 1.2 microM).
Although further studies are needed to elucidate the role of distinct CYP enzymes in the biotransformation of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> in humans, the findings of this study suggest that while both CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> by human liver microsomes, CYP1A2 is the more important isoform at clinically relevant <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> concentrations.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> also showed an inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, but <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (IC50 8.5 microM) was a much more potent inhibitor than <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (IC50 200 microM).
At 800 microM of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> , <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (IC50 20.7 microM) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (IC50 20.4 microM) displayed a modest inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, whereas <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> was a weak inhibitor (IC50 >250 microM).
The 3-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> was potently inhibited by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> at both <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> concentrations (IC50 0.16 microM at 5 microM and 1.8 microM at 800 microM).
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> showed a clear inhibitory effect on the 3-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> at 5 microM of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> (IC50 9.9 microM and 13.9 microM, respectively), but did not show a consistent effect at 800 microM of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> (IC50 >250 microM and 75.0 microM, respectively).
In vitro inhibition of human liver drug metabolizing enzymes by second generation antihistamines.
 <START:DRUG> cetirizine <END> , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> loratadine <END> , <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> and <START:DRUG> mizolastine <END> were compared for their ability to inhibit marker activities for CYP1A2 , CYP2C9,CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and for some glucuronidation isoenzymes in human liver microsomes.
A comparison of the inhibitory potencies of <START:DRUG> cetirizine <END> , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> loratidine <END> , <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> and <START:DRUG> mizolastine <END> with their corresponding plasma concentrations in humans suggests that these antihistamines are not likely to interfere with the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs, with the exception of <START:DRUG> loratidine <END> , which appears to inhibit CYP2C19 with sufficient potency to warrant additional investigation.
The most pronounced effects were observed with <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> and <START:DRUG> loratadine <END> which inhibited CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (IC50 of 23, 21 and 32 microM, respectively) and CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (IC50 of 18, 36 and 15 microM, respectively).
In addition, <START:DRUG> loratadine <END> markedly inhibited the CYP2C19 marker activity, (S)-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (Ki of 0.17 microM).
Furthermore, <START:DRUG> loratadine <END> activated the CYP2C9-catalyzed <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation (ca.
3-fold increase at 30 microM) and inhibited some glucuronidation enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> mizolastine <END> appeared to be a relatively weak and unspecific inhibitor of CYP2E1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (IC50Ss in the 100 micromolar range).
 <START:DRUG> cetirizine <END> demonstrated no effect on the investigated activities.
Characterization of the in vitro biotransformation of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> by human hepatic cytochromes P-450 .
 <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> (NVP), a non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, is concomitantly administered to patients with a variety of medications.
To assess the potential for its involvement in drug interactions, cytochrome P-450 (CYP) reaction phenotyping of NVP to its four oxidative metabolites, 2-, 3-, 8-, and 12-hydroxyNVP, was performed.
The NVP metabolite formation rates by characterized human hepatic microsomes were best correlated with probe activities for either CYP3A4 (2- and 12-hydroxyNVP) or CYP2B6 (3-and 8-hydroxyNVP).
In studies with cDNA-expressed human hepatic CYPs, 2- and 3-hydroxyNVP were exclusively formed by CYP3A and CYP2B6 , respectively.
Multiple cDNA-expressed CYPs produced 8- and 12-hydroxyNVP, although they were produced predominantly by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively.
Antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited the rates of 2-, 8-, and 12-hydroxyNVP formation by human hepatic microsomes, whereas antibody to CYP2B6 inhibited the formation of 3- and 8-hydroxyNVP.
Collectively, these data indicate that NVP is principally metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and that it has little potential to be involved in inhibitory drug interactions.
Studies using the CYP3A4 inhibitors <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> suggested a role for CYP3A4 in the formation of 2-, 8-, and 12-hydroxyNVP.
These inhibitors were less effective or ineffective against the biotransformation of NVP to 3-hydroxyNVP.
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> very weakly inhibited only 8-hydroxyNVP formation.
NVP itself was an inhibitor of only CYP3A4 at concentrations that were well above those of therapeutic relevance (K(i) = 270 microM).
 <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> inhibits metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> : competitive inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro.
 <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> decreases clearance of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> administered i.v., but the mechanism remains unclear.
To elucidate this mechanism, we have investigated the effect of <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> on metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 isoforms (n = 6).
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> was metabolized to <START:DRUG> l'-hydroxymidazolam <END> ( <START:DRUG> l'-OH MDZ <END> ) by human hepatic microsomes, with a Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) of 5.0 (SD 2.7) mumol litre-1.
Of the seven representative human hepatic P450 isoforms, CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2C9, 2C19 , 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 , only CYP3A4 catalysed hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , with a K(m) of 3.6 (0.8) mumol liter-1.
These findings indicate that <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> competitively inhibits metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> by CYP3A4 .
 <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> competitively inhibited metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in human hepatic microsomes, with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 26.8 (12.4) mumol litre-1.
 <START:DRUG> fentanyl <END> competitively inhibited metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> to <START:DRUG> l'-OH MDZ <END> by CYP3A4 , with a Ki of 24.2 (6.8) mumol litre-1, comparable with the Ki obtained in human hepatic microsomes.
Biotransformation of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> by members of the human cytochrome P4503A subfamily.
1.
To aid in the prediction of drug interactions with <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> , the human CYP involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> were characterized using human liver microsomes, expressed enzymes and selective chemical inhibitors .
2.
Only microsomes from B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP3A4 were capable of catalysing the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
3.
The formation rates of <START:DRUG> 1'-hydroxyalprazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxyalprazolam <END> at an <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> concentration of 1 mM were significantly correlated (n = 19, r = 0.95, p<0.01) indicating that the same enzyme(s) mediated these biotransformations .
A significant (p<0.01) correlation was observed between <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> 4- and 1'-hydroxylase activity and CYP3A-mediated <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 4-hydroxylase, <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylase, <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> N-demethylase and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> N-demethylase activities.
4.
In conclusion, in adult human liver the CYP3A subfamily members are the principal enzymes involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> .
Thus, clinically significant drug drug interactions between <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> and other CYP3A substrates are to be expected.
The formation of <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxyalprazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> 1'-hydroxyalprazolam <END> at an <START:DRUG> alprazolam <END> concentration of 62.5 microM were reduced by the prototypic CYP3A inhibitor , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (50 microM), by 97 and 9900 respectively.
Activation of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity by <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> in human liver microsomes.
1.
The roles of different human cytochrome P450s (CYP) in <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation were investigated using human liver microsomes and recombinant proteins.
2.
In recombinant CYP from human B-lymphoblast cells, POD activities at a <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> concentration of 500 microM were detected for CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 , as well as CYP1A2 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 .
In recombinant CYP from human B-lymphoblast cells or baculovirus-infected insect cells and in reconstituted systems, a requirement of cytochrome b5 (b5) for POD activities catalysed by CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 was observed.

Inter-individual differences in the effects of <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> on POD activity in human liver microsomes were observed, and the involvement of CYP3A4 as well as CYP1A2 in POD activity in human liver was identified even at a low substrate concentration.
 <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase (POD) activities in human liver microsomes at substrate concentrations of 10 and 500 microM were inhibited by 0.1 and 1 microM <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> and activated by 10 and 100 microM <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> .
The activation of POD activity in human liver microsomes by <START:DRUG> alphanaphthoflavone <END> was inhibited by 100 microM <START:DRUG> aniline <END> , anti-CYP2E1 antibody, 1 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and anti-CYP3A4 antibody.
The activation of POD activity by <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> was observed for CYP3A4 , but not for CYP2E1 .
Co-expression of b5 with CYP3A4 enhanced the activation of POD activity by <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> .
In the absence of <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , the POD activity in pooled human liver microsomes at 500 microM <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> was significantly inhibited (p<0.0001) by 10 microM <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , but not by 1 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
In the presence of <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , the activity was significantly inhibited (p<0.0001) by 1 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , but not by 10 microM <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> .
Mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450s 1A2 and 3A4 by <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> is known to induce immunoallergic hepatitis.
Since anti-liver microsome (anti-LM) autoantibodies found in the serum of the patients react with P450 1A2 , it is suggested that <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> is biotransformed into a reactive metabolite, which covalently binds to cytochrome P450 1A2 and triggers an immunological response as a neoantigen.
We investigated inactivation of P450 enzymes, including P450 1A2 , during the metabolism of <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> to evaluate the selectivity of P450 1A2 as a catalyst and a target of <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> .
Human liver microsomes or microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing P450 enzymes were preincubated with <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> in the presence of NADPH, followed by an assay of several monooxygenase activities.
The inactivation of both of the P450s followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and was saturable with increasing <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> concentrations.
Similar time-dependent decreases in the activities were obtained in the case for use in microsomes expressing P450 1A2 and P450 3A4 instead of the human liver microsomes.
The data support the postulated covalent binding of a reactive metabolite of <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> to P450 1A2 as a step in the formation of anti-LM antibodies in <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> hepatitis, but it is not the unique factor for determining the specificity of the autoantibodies.
Preincubation of human liver microsomes with <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> in the presence of NADPH resulted in decreases in <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity (an indicator of P450 1A2 activity) and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity (P450 3A4) , but not in <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylase activity (P450 2C9) , an indication of inactivation of P450s 1A2 and 3A4 during the <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> metabolism.
"
The data presented here demonstrated that <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> was metabolically activated not only by P450 1A2 but also by P450 3A4 , and the chemically reactive metabolite bound to and inactivated the enzyme themselves, suggesting that <START:DRUG> dihydralazine <END> is a mechanism-based inactivator of P450s 1A2 and 3A4.
Characterization of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
AIMS: To identify the human cytochrome P450 enzyme (s) involved in the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> , a potential oral antidiabetic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes-mellitus.
Method The specific P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> were determined by a combination of three approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the effect of selective chemical inhibitors on <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> metabolism and the capability of expressed P450 enzymes to mediate the major metabolic routes of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> metabolism.
Result The major products of metabolism following incubation of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and N-desmethyl <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47 human livers investigated and correlated with <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylation (P<0.001).
In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA.
There was some evidence for CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> .
Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> in human liver; with minor contributions from CYP2C9 .
Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by 13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor , but not by <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> or <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the metabolism of <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> , in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at a much slower rate than CYP2C8 .
 <START:DRUG> rosiglitazone <END> caused moderate inhibition of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylase activity ( CYP2C8 ; IC50=18 microM ), weak inhibition of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9 ; IC50=50 microM ) but caused no marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , 3A and 4A ) .
Participation of CYP2C8 in retinoic acid 4-hydroxylation in human hepatic microsomes.
Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) catalyze the 4-hydroxylation of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), an agent used in the treatment of certain malignancies.
Literature studies have implicated several CYPs in this reaction, but the relative importance of individual CYPs is unclear.
Human microsomal CYPs that contribute to the activity were evaluated by correlation with activities of hepatic drug-metabolizing CYPs, the capacity of cDNA-derived CYPs to catalyze the reaction, and inhibition of the microsomal activity by chemicals.
The Km for the reaction was 9 +/- 3 microM in hepatic microsomes (N = 3) and 6 microM in microsomes containing cDNA-derived CYP2C8 ; by comparison,Km values for the activity mediated by CYPs 2C9 and 3A4 were 100 and 74 microM, respectively.
These findings suggest that CYP2C8 is a major contributor to ATRA 4-hydroxylation in human liver and that 3A subfamily CYPs may be minor participants.
Individual variation in CYP2C8 and 3A4 expression may influence ATRA pharmacokinetics and drug interactions during therapy.
4-HydroxyATRA formation in microsomes varied 7-fold (8.7 to 61 pmol/mg protein/min) and correlated partially with activities mediated by CYPs 3A ,2C , and 1A (p = 0.53 to 0.66).
cDNA-derived CYPs 2C8 , 2C9 , and 3A4 , but not 1A1 or 1A2 , catalyzed ATRA 4-hydroxylation (2.53, 4.68, and 1.29 pmol/pmol CYP/hr).
Inhibition of microsomal ATRA 4-hydroxylation was elicited by chemicals that interact with CYP2C8 ( <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> ), but not those that interact with CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , and <START:DRUG> torasemide <END> ) .
The CYP3A inhibitor <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> and an anti-CYP3A IgG inhibited the activity slightly.
Greater inhibition was produced by the less selective CYP3A inhibitors <START:DRUG> parathion <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ; CYP1A inhibitors were ineffective.
Effect of antipsychotic drugs on human liver cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoforms in vitro: preferential inhibition of CYP2D6 .
The ability of antipsychotic drugs to inhibit the catalytic activity of five cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoforms was compared using in vitro human liver microsomal preparations to evaluate the relative potential of these drugs to inhibit drug metabolism.
The apparent kinetic parameters for enzyme inhibition were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the data.
The estimated K(i) values for the inhibition of CYP2C9 , 2C19 , and 3A were >300 microM in almost all antipsychotics tested.
These results suggest that antipsychotic drugs exhibit a striking selectivity for CYP2D6 compared with other CYP isoforms.
This may reflect a remarkable commonality of structure between the therapeutic targets for these drugs, the transporters, and metabolic enzymes that distribute and eliminate them.
Clinically, coadministration of these medicines with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 may result in significant drug interactions.
All antipsychotic drugs tested competitively inhibited <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation, a selective marker for CYP2D6 , in a concentration-dependent manner.
 <START:DRUG> thioridazine <END> and <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> were the most potent, with IC(50) values (2.7 and 1.5 microM) that were comparable to that of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (0.52 microM).
The estimated K(i) values for CYP2D6-catalyzing <START:DRUG> dextrorphan <END> formation were ranked in the following order: <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> (0.8 microM), <START:DRUG> thioridazine <END> (1.4 microM), <START:DRUG> chlorpromazine <END> (6.4 microM), <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> (7.2 microM), <START:DRUG> fluphenazine <END> (9.4 microM), <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (21.9 microM), <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> (39.0 microM), and <START:DRUG> cis-thiothixene <END> (65.0 microM).
No remarkable inhibition of other CYP isoforms was observed except for moderate inhibition of CYP1A2-catalyzed <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation by <START:DRUG> fluphenazine <END> (K(i) = 40.2 microM) and <START:DRUG> perphenazine <END> (K(i) = 65.1).
Multiple cytochrome P-450s involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> suggest a limited potential for drug-drug interactions.
Biotransformation pathways and the potential for drug-drug interactions of the orally active antifungal <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> were characterized using human liver microsomes and recombinant human cytochrome P-450s (CYPs) .
The <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> metabolites represented four major pathways: 1) N-demethylation, 2) deamination, 3) alkyl side chain oxidation, and 4) <START:DRUG> dihydrodiol <END> formation.
Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the pathways revealed mean K(m) values ranging from 4.4 to 27.8 microM, and V(max) values of 9.8 to 82 nmol/h/mg protein.
At least seven CYP enzymes are involved in <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> metabolism.
Recombinant human CYPs predict that CYP2C9 , CYP1A2 , and CYP3A4 are the most important for total metabolism.
"
N-demethylation is primarily mediated by CYP2C9 , CYP2C8 , and CYP1A2 ; <START:DRUG> dihydrodiol <END> formation by CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 ; deamination by CYP3A4 ; and side chain oxidation equally by CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 .
Additionally, characteristic CYP substrates inhibited pathways of <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> metabolite formation, confirming the involvement of multiple enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> had little or no effect on the metabolism of many characteristic CYP substrates.
In summary, <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> is metabolized by at least seven CYPs.
The potential for <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> interaction with other drugs is predicted to be insignificant with the exception that it may inhibit the metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates.
Clinical trials are needed to assess the relevance of these findings.
The deamination pathway was mainly inhibited by CYP3A inhibitors , including <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> and azole antifungals.
 <START:DRUG> dihydrodiol <END> formation was inhibited by the CYP1A2 inhibitor <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> .
 <START:DRUG> terbinafine <END> , however, is a competitive inhibitor of the CYP2D6 reaction, <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (K(i) = 0.03 microM).
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> artelinic acid <END> to dihydroqinqhaosu by human liver cytochrome P4503A.
1.
 <START:DRUG> artelinic acid <END> (AL), a water-soluble <START:DRUG> artemisinin <END> analogue for treatment of multidrug resistant malaria, is metabolized to the active metabolite <START:DRUG> dihydroqinghaosu <END> (DQHS) solely by CYP3A4/5 .
2.
In human liver microsomes, AL is metabolized to DQHS with a Km = 157 +/- 44 microM and Vmax = 0.77 +/- 0.56 nmol DQHS/min/mg protein.
The kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) for DQHS formation from CYP3A5 were 189 +/- 19 microM and 3.60 +/- 0.42 nmol DQHS/min/nmol P450 respectively.
3.
Inhibition studies suggest that azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers may present clinically significant drug drug interactions.
Although AL is not metabolized by CYP2C9, it does inhibit <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4-hydroxylase activity with an IC50 = 115 microM.
Interestingly, AL activate CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> metabolism in human liver microsomes but not recombinant CYP2D6-Val by approximately 30% at AL concentrations up to 100 microM.
Human recombinant CYP3A4 catalysed the conversion of AL to DQHS with a Km = 102 +/- 23 microM and a Vmax = 1.96 +/- 0.38 nmol DQHS/min/nmol P450.
In human liver microsomes, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> were potent competitive inhibitors of DQHS formation with a Ki = 0.028 and 0.124 microM respectively.
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> is a non-competitive inhibitor of DQHS formation in human liver microsomes with a Ki = 15 microM.
Comparative effects of <START:DRUG> rifabutin <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on cytochromes P450 and UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases expression in fresh and cryopreserved human hepatocytes.
The aim of this study was to evaluate <START:DRUG> rifabutin <END> (RBT) and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> (RIF) capabilities in inducing various xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases (UGTs) in cultured fresh and cryopreserved human hepatocytes.
Enzyme induction was assessed through the use of several diagnostic markers, i.e. <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (MDZ), <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> (DZP) and 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> for CYP-dependent enzyme reactions; and AZT for UGT-dependent enzyme reactions.
RBT concentrations (0.118, 0.708 microM) were selected according to previously published pharmacokinetic data in patients.
The known CYP3A4 inducer in humans, RIF, was used as a positive control.
At the concentrations used, no sign of cytotoxicity was evidenced.
The other hydroxylated metabolites (16alpha-OH and 2alpha-OH) were also enhanced.
The metabolism of MDZ , which is specifically metabolized by CYP3A4 in humans, was also investigated following drug's exposure to hepatocytes.
DZP one, which is governed by various CYPs , including CYP3A , was also investigated.
Moreover, the effects of both drugs on <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase activity (EROD), which is representative of CYPIA1/2 isoforms, were tested.
Results showed only a moderate induction of this marker (approximately 2-fold over control) when compared to the high effect observed after hepatocyte exposure to 3-methylcholantene (approximately 14-fold over control).
On the whole, exposure of fresh or cryopreserved human hepatocytes to RBT dose-dependently affected the levels of drug metabolizing enzymes in a dose-dependent manner.
However, as already demonstrated by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, its inducing properties towards CYPs , CYP3A in particular, are less pronounced than RIF.
Both compounds were able to dose-dependently induce the overall metabolism of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (approximately 2-fold for RBT, 4-fold for RIF) and the formation of the 6beta-hydroxylated-derivative (up to approximately 4-fold over control for RBT and approximately 10-fold for RIF), which is CYP3A4 dependent.
RBT was shown to increase the biotransformation of both benzodiazepines (approximately 1.9-fold over control).
Finally, the action of RBT and RIF on UGTs expression was investigated by using AZT as diagnostic substrate: glucuronides formation was not significantly affected by the two <START:DRUG> rifamycin <END> derivatives .
Use of the steroid derivative <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> in combination with site-directed mutagenesis for enhanced cytochrome P-450 3A4 structure/function analysis.
 <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> (20R-16alpha,17alpha-[butylidenebis(oxy)]-6al pha, 9alpha-difluoro-11beta-hydroxy-17beta-(methylthio)androst a-4-en-3-one) is an airway-selective steroid developed for the treatment of asthma.
Two metabolites produced by human liver microsomes were identified as R- and S-sulfoxide diastereomers based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and cochromatography with standards.
The high rate of sulfoxidation by CYP3A4 and the blockage of oxidative metabolism at the electronically favored 6beta-position provided advantages for <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> over other substrates as an active site probe of CYP3A4 .
Therefore, oxidation of <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> by various CYP3A4 substrate recognition site (SRS) mutants was assessed.
In conclusion, the structure of <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> imposes specific constraints on enzyme binding and activity and thus represents an improved CYP3A4 probe substrate.
Sulfoxide formation was determined to be cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4-dependent by correlation with CYP3A4-marker <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidase activity,inhibition by <START:DRUG> cyclosporin A <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and inhibition of R- (70%) and S- (64%) sulfoxide formation by anti-3A antibody.
Expressed CYP2C forms catalyzed <START:DRUG> rPR 106541 <END> sulfoxidation; however, other phenotyping approaches failed to confirm the involvement of CYP2C forms in these reactions in human liver microsomes .
Expressed CYP3A4 catalyzed the formation of the sulfoxide diastereomers in a 1:1 ratio, whereas CYP3A5 displayed stereoselectivity for formation of the <START:DRUG> s-diastereomer <END> .
In SRS-4, A305V and F304A showed dramatically reduced rates of R-diastereomer formation (83 and 64% decreases, respectively), but <START:DRUG> s-diastereomer <END> formation was affected to a lesser extent.
A370V (SRS-5) showed decreased formation of the <START:DRUG> r-sulfoxide <END> (52%) but increased formation of the <START:DRUG> s-diastereomer <END> .
In the SRS-2 region, the most dramatic change in sulfoxide ratios was observed for L210A.
Inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and its metabolites on drug oxidation catalyzed by human cytochrome P-450 enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> , an antiallergy and antiasthmatic drug, has been reported to be metabolized mainly to <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> and <START:DRUG> 6-hydroxyazelastine <END> in mammals.
In the present study, the inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and its two metabolites on human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoform-dependent reactions were investigated to predict the drug interactions of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> using microsomes from human B-lymphoblast cells expressing CYP.
The specific activities for human CYP isoforms included: 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A1) , <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation ( CYP2A6), 7-benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation (CYP2B6 ), S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> 7-hydroxylation (CYP2C9 ), <START:DRUG> s-mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19 ), <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation ( CYP2D6 ), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4).
In almost all the activities, <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> exhibited stronger inhibition than <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and <START:DRUG> 6-hydroxyazelastine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> 6-hydroxyazelastine <END> interfered with the determination of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation by HPLC.
In consideration of the Ki values and the concentration of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> in human livers after chronic oral administration of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> , the possibility of in vivo drug interaction of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and other drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 was suggested although it might not cause critical side effects.
The inhibition of CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4 activity by <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and its two metabolites might be clinically significant.
 <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> , but not <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and <START:DRUG> 6-hydroxyazelastine <END> , uncompetitively inhibited CYP2B6 activity (Ki = 32.6 +/- 4.8 microM).
 <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> , <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> , and <START:DRUG> 6-hydroxyazelastine <END> competitively inhibited CYP2C9 activity (Ki = 13.9 +/- 1.8, 15.0 +/- 3.1, and 17.0 +/- 4.1 microM, respectively), CYP2C19 activity (Ki = 21.9 +/- 2.2, 7.3 +/- 1.6, and 9.3 +/- 1.6 microM, respectively), and CYP2D6 activity (Ki = 1.2 +/- 0.1, 1.5 +/- 0.2, and 3.0 +/- 0.5 microM, respectively).
 <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and <START:DRUG> desmethylazelastine <END> competitively inhibited CYP3A4 activity (Ki = 23.7 +/- 4.6 and 13.2 +/- 2.3 microM).
CYP1A2, CYP2A6 , and CYP2E1 activities were not significantly inhibited by <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and the two metabolites.
Among the human CYPs tested, the inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> azelastine <END> and its two metabolites were the most potent on human CYP2D6 .
 <START:DRUG> methadone <END> N-demethylation in human liver microsomes: lack of stereoselectivity and involvement of CYP3A4 .
To investigate the kinetics of CYP-mediated N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> in human liver microsomes, and examine the role of stereoselectivity and CYP isoforms involved.
The kinetics of 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) formation via N-demethylation of rac-, (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> in human liver microsomes prepared from six liver samples were determined by h.p.l.c., and inhibition of metabolic function was studied using isoform-specific chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.
Microsomes containing expressed CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were also used to examine the formation of EDDP.
The V max, Km, and CLint values for the formation of EDDP from rac-, (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> were in the ranges of 20-77 nmol mg-1 protein h-1, 125-252 microm, and 91-494 ml h-1 g-1 protein.
Km and CLint values for (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> were not statistically significantly different (P >0.05), while V max values for (S)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> were 15% (P=0.045) lower than for (R)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> .
There were no statistically significant differences in the inhibition observed between the three substrates.
man liver microsomes were identified as R- and S-sulfoxide diastereomers based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and cochromatography with standards.
The N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> in human liver microsomes is not markedly stereoselective, and is mediated mainly by CYP3A4 with the possible involvement of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .
Thus, the large interindividual variation reported for <START:DRUG> methadone <END> pharmacokinetics may be due to variability in the expression of these CYP isoforms, and the reported stereoselectivity in the systemic clearance of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> in vivo is not due to stereoselectivity in N-demethylation.
Expressed CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 showed similar reaction rates for both (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> methadone <END> , while CYP2D6 did not catalyse this reaction.
Selective chemical inhibitors of CYP3A ( <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) and monoclonal human CYP3A4 antibodies significantly inhibited (P<0.05) the formation of EDDP in a concentration dependent manner by up to 80%.
 <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9) also significantly inhibited (P<0.05) EDDP formation (range 14-25%).
Selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 ( <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> ), CYP2A6 ( <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> ), CYP2C19 ( (S)-mephenytoin ), CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ) and CYP2E1 (diethyldithiocarbamic acid sodium salt and monoclonal human CYP2E1 antibodies) had no significant (P >0.05) effect.
Comparative in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A by H2-receptor antagonists.
The isozymes CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4/5 are involved in the majority of all cytochrome P450-mediated drug biotransformations.
In this study we investigated the inhibition profiles of CYP1A2 (substrate: <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> ) CYP2D6 (substrate: <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> ), and CYP3A4/5 (substrate: <START:DRUG> dextrorphan <END> ) by <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> , <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> , and the novel H2-receptor antagonist <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> in human liver microsomes.
The inhibition of CYP3A4/5 enzyme activity by <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> was competitive.
To test whether the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> in CYP3A activity was also found in vivo, we analyzed the biodisposition of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> in 8 healthy volunteers.
Psychomotor performance analysis revealed no significant effect of the observed reduction on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> biodisposition.
We concluded that patients who are receiving treatment with drugs metabolized through CYP3A may experience enhanced drug effects as a result of pharmacokinetic interaction when treated concomitantly with <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> .
In contrast,the effect of <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> or <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> on CYP3A activity in vivo seems to have little clinical significance.
The inhibitory effect of the drugs on the enzymes activities were as follows: CYP1A2 : <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> > <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> = <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> ; CYP2D6 : <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> > <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> = <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> ; CYP3A4/5: <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> > <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> > <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> biodisposition was significantly reduced when administered together with <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> (P < .05), whereas no significant inhibition was observed with <START:DRUG> ebrotidine <END> or <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> compared with placebo.
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> benzene <END> in human liver microsomes: individual variations in relation to CYP2E1 expression.
None of these metabolic rates correlated with immunochemically determined levels of CYP1A2 , 2C9 , and 3A4 nor oxidation of 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , and <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> benzene <END> oxidation to water-soluble metabolites was characterized by typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
The different <START:DRUG> benzene <END> K(m) values seen in individual human microsomal samples were not correlated with the level or activity of CYP1A2 , 2C9 , 2E1 , and 3A4 but could be due to CYP2E1 microheterogeneity.
The lowest K(m) for <START:DRUG> benzene <END> oxidation could be related to C/D and/or c1/c2 polymorphism of CYP2E1 gene.
Covalent binding of <START:DRUG> benzene <END> reactive metabolites to microsomal proteins was also correlated with the CYP2E1 metabolic rates and immunochemical levels.
At high concentrations of <START:DRUG> benzene <END> covalent binding was inversely related to <START:DRUG> benzene <END> concentrations (as well as to formation of water-soluble metabolites) in agreement with the view that secondary metabolites, mainly <START:DRUG> benzoquinone <END> , are responsible for the covalent binding.
In human liver microsomes the oxidations of <START:DRUG> benzene <END> , <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , <START:DRUG> aniline <END> , <START:DRUG> dimethylformamide <END> , and 4-nitrophenol were significantly correlated with each other and with the level of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 estimated by immunoblotting.
Moreover, <START:DRUG> benzene <END> oxidation to water-soluble metabolites was suppressed by 0.1 mM <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , supposedly a specific inhibitor of CYP2E1 at this level.
Structure-related inhibition of human hepatic <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N3-demethylation by naturally occurring flavonoids.
The effects of flavonoids on <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N3-demethylation, a marker activity of CYP1A2 , in human liver microsomes were investigated to elucidate the inhibition mechanism and the structure-activity relationship.
Others had IC50 values ranging from 1 to more than 500 microM.
Kinetic analysis revealed that the mechanism of inhibition varied among the flavonoids.
The inhibitory effect was postulated to be governed by factors such as the number of hydroxyl groups and glycosylation of these free hydroxyl groups.
An increase in the number of free hydroxyl groups reduced the inhibitory effect on P450 activity.
Analysis of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) showed that the volume to surface area ratio was the most effective factor on the inhibition of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N3-demethylation, and the electron densities on the C3 and C4' atoms exercised significant influence on the inhibitory effect.
The calculated inhibitory effect of flavonoids on CYP1A2 activity was highly correlated with the antimutagenicity of flavonoids in 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-flquinoline (MelQ)-induced umu response.
 <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N3-demethylase activity was inhibited by the presence of various flavonoids, whose structures seem to be closely related to the degree of inhibition.
Among twenty-one compounds tested, the most active was chrysin with an IC50 value of 0.2 microM.
Human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) mediated <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> metabolism : the effect of assay conditions and regioselective stimulation by <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> .
The effect of ionic strength, assay constituents, <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> ( <START:DRUG> aNF <END> ) , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> on human CYP3A mediated <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation ( <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> ) and 4-hydroxylation ( <START:DRUG> mDZ 4-OH <END> ) in vitro was examined.
Increasing concentration of Tris-HCl (Tris) and sodium phosphate ( <START:DRUG> pO4 <END> ) buffers differentially affected <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> and <START:DRUG> mDZ 4-OH <END> formation rates and had a different effect on MDZ metabolism mediated by microsomes containing CYP3A4 versus CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
MDZ metabolism was not affected by <START:DRUG> pO4 <END> buffer concentration when cumene hydroperoxide (CUOOH) was used as the source of reactive oxygen.
Interestingly, the ammonium ion present in the solution of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to inhibit MDZ metabolism .
The addition of <START:DRUG> mgCl2 <END> up to 50 mM and <START:DRUG> caCl2 <END> (5-30 mM) had no affect or inhibited MDZ metabolism , respectively.
These studies indicate that because assay conditions can substantially alter the catalytic activity of CYP3A , caution should be exerted when extrapolating results between in vitro and in vivo, and when results from different laboratories are compared.
Further, these results suggest that the stimulation of CYP3A4 may also occur in vivo and, consequently, may have clinical importance.
Formation of <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> by microsomes from adult and fetal liver and expressed CYP3A4 was regioselectively stimulated by <START:DRUG> aNF <END> (10 microM).
In human hepatocytes, <START:DRUG> aNF <END> stimulated <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> formation (up to 100%).
 <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> (20 microM) regioselectively stimulated <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> formation in Tris (1-200 mM) and <START:DRUG> pO4 <END> (1-10 mM) buffers by up to 159%.
Surprisingly, with expressed CYP3A4 , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> (20 microM) inhibited <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> formation.
 <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> (20 microM) had little effect on <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> formation by fetal liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (10 and 100 microM) regioselectively stimulated (up to 269%) <START:DRUG> mDZ 4-OH <END> formation by adult liver microsomes and expressed CYP3A4 .
 <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (100 microM) inhibited (> 40%) <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> and <START:DRUG> mDZ 4-OH <END> formation by fetal liver microsomes.
With adult liver microsomes, <START:DRUG> aNF <END> and <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> had little effect on the Km for <START:DRUG> mDZ 1'-OH <END> formation.
However, the Km for <START:DRUG> mDZ 4-OH <END> formation was decreased (up to 94%) by 100 microM <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> .
In the presence of CUOOH, no stimulation of MDZ metabolism was observed by <START:DRUG> aNF <END> , <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> or <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> in adult liver microsomes.
Identification of CYP3A4 as the major enzyme responsible for 25-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol <END> in human liver microsomes.
Human liver microsomes catalyze an efficient 25-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol <END> .
The hydroxylation is involved in a minor, alternative pathway for side-chain degradation in the biosynthesis of cholic acid.
The enzyme responsible for the microsomal 25-hydroxylation has been unidentified.
In the present study, recombinant expressed human P-450 enzymes have been used to screen for 25-hydroxylase activity towards 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha,12alpha-triol.
High activity was found with CYP3A4 , but also with CYP3A5 and to a minor extent with CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 .
Small amounts of 23- and 24-hydroxylated products were also formed by CYP3A4 .
The Vmax for 25-hydroxylation by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was 16 and 4.5 nmol/(nmolxmin), respectively.
The Km was 6 microM for CYP3A4 and 32 microM for CYP3A5 .
Cytochrome b5 increased the hydroxylase activities.
Human liver microsomes from ten different donors, in which different P-450 marker activities had been determined, were incubated with 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha, 12alpha-triol.
A strong correlation was observed between formation of 25-hydroxylated <START:DRUG> 5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol <END> and CYP3A levels (r2=0.96).
No correlation was observed with the levels of CYP2C19 .
From these results, it can be concluded that CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme responsible for 25-hydroxylation of 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha,12alpha-triol in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4 and 3A5 , inhibited the 25-hydroxylase activity of pooled human liver microsomes by more than 90% at 50 microM.
Tranylcypromine , an inhibitor of CYP2C19 , had very little effect on the conversion.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> inhibits the CYP2C19-catalysed metabolism of <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> in vitro.
The potent CYP1A2 inhibitor <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> has recently been shown also to be an effective inhibitor of the CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of the antimalarial drug <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> in vivo.
The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro.
A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formed from <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> by microsomes prepared from human liver.
The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'.h-I.
This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors : <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> bromocriptine <END> , <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> dihydroergotamine <END> .
The combination of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> can not be recommended.
The formation of 4-CPBG and <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme,probably CYP3A4 , is very low.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> , displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation.
As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1).
 <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> inhibited <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 .
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , <START:DRUG> clomipramine <END> , <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> and <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> .
Pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> in human-immunodeficiency-virus-infected patients receiving <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> once daily.
The effect of <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> once-daily dosing on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> and its main metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, was evaluated in ten HIV positive patients on stable <START:DRUG> methadone <END> therapy.
 <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> 200 mg once daily was administered orally from day 1 to day 14.
On day 15, <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> dose was increased to 400 mg once daily for the following 7 days of study and thereafter.
On days 0, 8, and 22, concentration-time profiles of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> and its metabolite were collected after <START:DRUG> methadone <END> intake.
Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed.
Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained on days 8 and 22 were compared with those obtained before <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> administration.
After starting <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> treatment, nine out of ten patients experienced symptoms of abstinence syndrome, and <START:DRUG> methadone <END> dose had to be increased by 20% on average during the course of the study.
Switching to high dose <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> (400 mg once daily) did not result in a greater decrease in the <START:DRUG> methadone <END> AUC and C(max) compared with 200 mg <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> .
None of the noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolite evidenced statistically significant differences across the three study periods.
The decrease in <START:DRUG> methadone <END> AUC and C(max) administrated once daily was similar to that seen in other studies with <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> administrated twice daily, suggesting that the degree of induction of <START:DRUG> methadone <END> metabolism by <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> is similar for both dosing regimens.
After 7 days with <START:DRUG> nevirapine <END> 200 mg, <START:DRUG> methadone <END> area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C(max)) values were reduced by 63.3% and 55.2%, respectively.
A comparative pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers of the effect of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> and <START:DRUG> oxcarbazepine <END> on cyp3a4.
 <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> (CBZ) and <START:DRUG> oxcarbazepine <END> (OXCZ) are well-known inducers of drug metabolism via CYP3A4.
Indirect interaction studies and clinical experience suggest that CBZ has a stronger potential in this regard than OXCZ.
However this has never been subject to a direct comparative study.
We performed a study in healthy volunteers to investigate the relative inductive effect of CBZ and OXCZ on CYP3A4 activity using the metabolism of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> as a biomarker reaction.
Ten healthy, male volunteers participated in an open, randomized crossover study consisting of two periods separated by a 4-week wash-out period.
The subjects received 1200 mg oral OXCZ daily for 17 days and 800 mg oral CBZ for 17 days.
A single 200 mg oral dose of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> was administered at baseline and following administration of CBZ and OXCZ.
Outcome parameters were the formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine dose and the ratio of the AUCs of 3-hydroxyquinidine to <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
The relative inductive effect of CBZ was 46% higher than for OXCZ.
tmax was not changed in either period.
The inductive effect of CBZ was about 46% higher than that of OXCZ, a difference that may be of clinical relevance.
Formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine was increased by means of 89% (CI: 36-164; p=0.0022) and 181% (CI: 120-260, p<0.0001) after treatment with OXCZ and CBZ, respectively, compared to baseline.
AUC ratio increased by means of 161% (CI: 139-187, p<0.0001) (OXCZ) and 222% (CI: 192-257, p<0.0001) (CBZ).
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> Cmax decreased by means of 29% (CI: 16-40, p=0.0018) (OXCZ) and 33% (CI: 18-45, p=0.0020) (CBZ).
t1/2decreased by means of 12% (CI: 6-17, p<0.0014) (OXCZ) and 32% (CI: 25-38, p<0.0001) (CBZ).
We confirm a clinically significant inductive effect of both OXCZ and CBZ.
Effect of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> in HIV-infected patients.
To investigate the effect of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> on the <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients.
Twelve HIV-infected patients were assigned into a one-sequence, two-period pharmacokinetic interaction study.
In phase one, the patients received 400 mg of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> as a single oral dose on day 1; in phase two, they received 600 mg of <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> once daily in combination with 150 mg of <START:DRUG> lamivudine <END> and 30 or 40 mg of <START:DRUG> stavudine <END> twice daily on days 2 to 16.
On day 16, 400 mg of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was added to the regimen as a single oral dose.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 16.
C(max) and AUC(0-24) were significantly decreased by 44 and 72%, respectively.
The T ((1/2)) was significantly shorter by 58%.
Pretreatment with <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> significantly increased the clearance of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> by 201%.
 <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> has a strong inducing effect on the metabolism of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> : the role of gut transporters.
A recent in vitro study has shown that <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.
However, there was no in vivo information indicating the involvement of P-glycoprotein on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
Two 6 day courses of either 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> daily or placebo with at least a 4 week washout period were conducted.
Thirteen volunteers took a single oral 20 mg dose of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> on day 6 of both courses.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> were monitored up to 48 hours after the dosing.
Although elimination half-life differed significantly (16.1 +/- 3.4 versus 18.8 +/- 5.9 hours, P < 0.05), the alteration was small (1.1 fold).
Compared with placebo, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> by 1.3 fold (6.7 +/- 2.5 versus 9.0 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 48 hours [AUC (0-48)] of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> by 1.5 fold (137 +/- 73 versus 199 +/- 91 ng*h/mL, P < 0.01).
The present study demonstrated that the bioavailability of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> was increased by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , suggesting a possible involvement of P-glycoprotein in the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> interacts with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> but not with <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> disposition kinetics.
The aim of this study was to determine the influence of <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> in humans.
This was a prospective, crossover, randomized, open-label study performed in 12 healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> (40 mg) or <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> (40 mg) taken alone and after 3 days of <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> (400 mg/day).
If <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> and a statin have to be simultaneously prescribed, <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> should be preferred to <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> in order to avoid a drug interaction.
 <START:DRUG> amiodarone <END> increased <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve)0-24 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), and t1/2 by 73% (P=0.02), 100% (P=0.02), and 48% (P=0.06), respectively, whereas it did not significantly alter <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> pharmacokinetics.
Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> lactone, and <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> AUC(0-24 h) were 154% (109-216%), 155% (109-227%), and 86% (63-118%), respectively.
Effects of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> .
Case reports suggest that <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> can increase the glucose-lowering effect of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> which is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein and OATP2B1.
Our objective was to evaluate whether the P-glycoprotein inhibitor, <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> , increases and the putative OATP2B1 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> , decreases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> .
In a randomized three-phase crossover study, 12 subjects ingested 250 mg <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> or placebo twice daily or 200 ml <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> three times daily for 2 days.
On day 3, they ingested 0.875 mg <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> with sugar water or <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> .
Concentrations of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> and <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> in plasma, glucose in blood, and excretion of hydroxy- <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> into urine were measured up to 12 h.
"
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> concentrations implied a good compliance.
Blood glucose did not deviate between the phases.
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> increased the peak concentration (C(max)) of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> to 1.25-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.40; P < 0.01) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 1.35-fold (95% CI 1.21, 1.50; P < 0.01) compared with the placebo phase.
The time to C(max), the half-life of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> , and the amount of hydroxy- <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> excreted into urine remained unaltered.
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> did not change the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> .
 <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> increased plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> , possibly by inhibiting P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall.
Although not seen with the present study design, <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> may enhance the effect of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> by increasing plasma <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> concentrations, which warrants close monitoring of blood glucose during their co-administration.
 <START:DRUG> grapefruit juice <END> had no effect on <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> pharmacokinetics.
Significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> with the NO-independent sGC activator <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> .
 <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> is a new nitric oxide (NO)-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in development for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and chronic heart failure.
A significant fraction of patients to be treated with <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> is expected to be maintained on <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
Because <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> is an inhibitor and <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> a substrate of CYP2C9, the authors studied whether <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are influenced by <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> .
Eighteen healthy males were to receive a single oral dose of 20 mg <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> each under steady-state conditions of <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> or placebo.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> , (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> , and its 7-hydroxy-metabolites were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and prothrombin time, and the international standardized ratio was determined by the nephelometric method.
These data demonstrate a CYP2C9-mediated pharmacokinetic interaction with pharmacodynamic, clinically relevant consequences, which might require <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> dose adjustment.
(S)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> AUC(inf) and t(1/2) were 106,471 h x microg/L and 82.92 hours versus 33,148 h x microg/L under <START:DRUG> hMR1766 <END> and 31.72 hours under placebo, and the maximum decrease in prothrombin time values after <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> dosing was 58.75% versus 39.94%.
Inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> in humans.
CYP1A2 is involved in the metabolism of both <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> and <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> , a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent.
Despite the widespread consumption of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , drug-drug interactions with this agent are often overlooked.
This study investigated effects of <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> .
Eight healthy volunteers were included in our study.
A total of 300 mg of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> was given on 2 occasions, once alone and once during the coadministration of 300 mg <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> .
Serial blood samples were collected and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a population pharmacokinetic approach.
A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination described plasma concentration profiles.
One of our volunteers was a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6.
Concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> to this volunteer caused the greatest increase in <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> plasma concentrations.
 <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> has intrinsic proarrhythmic effects; thus, its coadministration with an antiarrhythmic agent such as <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> should be used with caution, especially in patients with poor CYP2D6 activity.
Concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> decreased <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> oral clearance from 8.3 +/- 0.9 L/h to 5.4 +/- 0.7 L/h (P < 0.05).
Elimination half-life of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> was also increased 54% by <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> .
These results support the concept of competitive inhibition between <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> .
Our results suggest that <START:DRUG> propafenone <END> causes significant inhibition of CYP1A2 activity leading to a decrease in the clearance of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2: studies with <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> in healthy subjects.
Case reports suggest an interaction between <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> and the CYP1A2 substrate <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
Our objectives were to explore the extent and mechanism of this possible interaction and to determine the CYP1A2 inhibitory potency of <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> .
In a randomized, double-blind, two-phase cross-over study, nine healthy subjects took 25 mg <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> or placebo daily for 4 days and, on day 4, each ingested 4 mg <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
Plasma concentrations and the urinary excretion of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> , its metabolites (M) and <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> , and pharmacodynamic variables were measured up to 24 h.
On day 3, a <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> test was performed to estimate CYP1A2 activity.
Finally, the AUC(0-25) of <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> correlated with the placebo phase <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> / <START:DRUG> paraxanthine <END> ratio (r = 0.80, P = 0.01).
The findings suggest that <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> itself is also metabolized by CYP1A2, raising concerns about interactions between <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> and other CYP1A2 substrate and inhibitor drugs.
 <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> by 13.6-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0, 15.6; P < 0.001), peak plasma concentration (C(max)) by 6.1-fold (4.8, 7.3; P < 0.001) and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 1.6 to 3.0 h (P < 0.001).
Consequently, <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> markedly increased the blood pressure-lowering and sedative effects of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> (P < 0.05).
 <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> increased several fold the <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /M-3 and <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /M-4 ratios in plasma and urine and the <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /M-5, <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /M-9 and <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /M-10 ratios in urine (P < 0.05).
In addition, it increased the plasma <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> / <START:DRUG> paraxanthine <END> ratio by 2.4-fold (95% CI 1.4, 3.4; P = 0.008) and this ratio correlated with the <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> /metabolite ratios.
 <START:DRUG> rofecoxib <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and it greatly increases the plasma concentrations and adverse effects of <START:DRUG> tizanidine <END> .
Effect of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of oral <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP1A2 enzymes, but inhibitors of CYP3A4 have had only a minor effect on its pharmacokinetics.
We studied the effect of co-administration of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (CYP1A2 inhibitor) and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> in a double-blind, randomized, three-way cross-over study.
Eight healthy volunteers ingested daily either 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and placebo, 100 mg <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and 1500 mg <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , or their corresponding placebos (control) for five days.
On day 6, 1 mg/kg <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> was administered orally.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> , monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and 3-hydroxylidocaine (3-OH- <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> ) were measured for 10 hr.
During the <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> phase the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) of oral <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> were 305% (P<0.001) and 220% (P<0.05) of the control values.
During the combination of <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> AUC was 360% (P<0.001) and Cmax 250% (P<0.05) of those during placebo.
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> alone had no statistically significant effect on the half-life of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> (t1/2), but during the combination phase t1/2 (3.8 hr) was significantly longer than during the placebo phase (2.4 hr; P<0.01).
 <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> alone and in the combination with <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> decreased MEGX peak concentrations by approximately 50% (P<0.001) and 30% (P<0.01), respectively.
We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> considerably reduces the presystemic metabolism of oral <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> and may increase the risk of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> toxicity if <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> is ingested.
The concomitant use of both <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and a CYP3A4 inhibitor like <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> may further increase plasma <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> concentrations.
Potent cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype-related interaction between <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and the cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> elimination.
Because the activity of CYP2C19 is under genetic control, the extent of inhibition with a CYP3A4 inhibitor was expected to be modulated by the CYP2C19 metabolizer status.
This study thus assessed the effect of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> after short-term administration on <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> pharmacokinetics in extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 20 healthy participants who were stratified according to CYP2C19 genotype received oral <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (300 mg twice daily) or placebo for 2 days.
Together with the first <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> or placebo dose, a single oral dose of 400 mg <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> was administered.
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> was determined in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis.
When given alone, the apparent oral clearance of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> after single oral dosing was 26%+/-16% (P > .05) lower in CYP2C19*1/*2 individuals and 66%+/-14% (P < .01) lower in CYP2C19 PMs.
This reduction occurred in all CYP2C19 genotypes (463+/-168 mL/min versus 305+/-112 mL/min [P = .023] for *1/*1, 343+/-127 mL/min versus 190+/-93 mL/min [P = .008] for *1/*2, and 158+/-54 mL/min versus 22+/-11 mL/min for *2/*2) and is probably caused by inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> metabolism.
Coadministration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor leads to a higher and prolonged exposure with <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> that might increase the risk of the development of adverse drug reactions on a short-term basis, particularly in CYP2C19 PM patients.
The addition of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> caused a major reduction in <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> apparent oral clearance (354+/-173 mL/min versus 202+/-139 mL/min, P = .0001).
Effect of the CYP3A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of lignocaine and its pharmacologically active metabolites in subjects with normal and impaired liver function.
The objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the effect of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous lignocaine and its two pharmacologically active metabolites, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX); (ii) to assess whether the effects of the <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> inhibitory action on lignocaine clearance and the results of the MEGX liver function test depend on liver functional status; and (iii) to determine the effects of both moderate and severe liver dysfunction on the disposition kinetics of lignocaine.
The study was carried out on 10 healthy volunteers, and 10 Child's class A and 10 class C cirrhotic patients, according to a double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover design.
On day 1 of the investigation, all subjects received three oral doses of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (600 mg of the ethylsuccinate ester) or placebo, and two further doses on day 2.
One hour after the fourth dose, subjects were given 1 mg kg-1 lignocaine intravenously.
Timed plasma samples were then obtained until 12 h for determination of the concentrations of lignocaine, MEGX and GX.
Quantitatively similar modifications were observed in the two cirrhotic groups.
Only in patients with Child's grade C liver cirrhosis were lignocaine kinetic parameters significantly altered with respect to healthy volunteers.
Thus, clearance was approximately halved, steady-state volume of distribution was increased, and terminal half-life was more than doubled.
A pharmacodynamic study following lignocaine infusion to steady state appears necessary to assess the actual clinical relevance of these combined effects.
The degree of liver dysfunction has no influence on the extent of the <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> -lignocaine interaction, whereas it markedly influences the extent of the changes in lignocaine pharmacokinetics.
These findings indicate that no dose adjustment is needed in patients with moderate liver cirrhosis, whereas the lignocaine dose should be halved in patients with severe cirrhosis.
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> caused statistically significant, although limited, modifications of lignocaine and MEGX pharmacokinetic parameters.
In healthy volunteers, lignocaine clearance was decreased from 9.93 to 8.15 ml kg-1 min-1 [mean percentage ratio (95% CI), 82 (65-98)] and the half-life was prolonged from 2.23 to 02.80 h [mean percentage ratio (95% CI), 130 (109-151)]; MEGX area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to 12 h was increased from 665 to 886 ng ml-1 h [mean percentage ratio (95% CI), 129 (102-156)].
GX concentrations were lowered in all study groups, although not to statistically significant extents.
 <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> coadministration caused no appreciable interference with the results of the MEGX test.
Although <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> only modestly decreases lignocaine clearance, it causes a concomitant elevation of the concentrations of its pharmacologically active metabolite MEGX.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> markedly decreases plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> is extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
The CYP3A isoforms are likely to be major enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (INN, rifampicin), a potent enzyme inducer of CYP-mediated metabolism (especially CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4), is known to markedly decrease plasma concentrations and effects of a number coadministered drugs.
The aim of this investigation was to study the possible pharmacokinetic interaction between <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> .
An open, randomized, 2-phase crossover design was used in each study of single or multiple doses.
In the single-dose study, 10 healthy Thai male volunteers ingested single doses of 40 mg/kg <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> alone (phase 1) or after pretreatment with 600 mg of oral <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> once daily for 5 days (phase 2).
In the multiple-dose study, all participants received multiple doses of 25 mg/kg <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> alone (phase 1) or after 5-day pretreatment with 600 mg of oral <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> once daily (phase 2).
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in each phase were determined by the HPLC method.
In the single-dose study, <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> decreased plasma <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> concentrations to undetectable levels in 7 of 10 subjects, whereas <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> concentrations were reduced by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> to undetectable levels in 5 of 10 subjects in the multiple-dose study.
Because <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> are widely used in the treatment of liver flukes (Opisthorchis viverrini) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively, in Thailand and in some other countries in southeast Asia, the possibility of one drug influencing the pharmacokinetics of the other must be considered.
Therefore simultaneous use of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> and <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> must be avoided in medical practice to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> .
In 3 subjects with measurable concentrations in the single-dose study, <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly decreased the mean maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> by 81% (P <.05) and 85% (P <.01), respectively, whereas <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> significantly decreased the mean C(max) and AUC(0-24) of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> by 74% (P <.05) and 80% (P <.01), respectively, in 5 subjects with measurable concentrations in the multiple-dose study.
The mean C(max) and AUC(0-24) of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> in subjects whose <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> concentrations could not be detected in the single-dose study (7 subjects) after <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> pretreatment were reduced by approximately 99% (P <.001) and 94% (P <.001), respectively, and in the multiple-dose study (5 subjects), they were reduced by 98% (P <.05) and 89% (P <.01), respectively.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> greatly decreased plasma concentrations of single and multiple oral doses of <START:DRUG> praziquantel <END> to levels lower than that of the minimum therapeutic concentration.
Plasma concentrations of inhaled <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> and its effects on plasma <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> are increased by the cytochrome P4503A4 inhibitor <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
Our objective was to examine the effects of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on the pharmacokinetics and <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> -suppressant activity of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> administered by inhalation.
In a randomized, double-blind, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy subjects took 200 mg <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
On day 5, 1 hour after the last dose of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> or placebo, 1000 microg <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> was administered by inhalation.
Plasma <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> and <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentrations were measured up to 23 hours.
This interaction resulted in enhanced systemic effects of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> , as shown by suppression of <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> production.
Long-term coadministration of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> and a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> .
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> increased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of inhaled <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> 4.2-fold (range, 1.7-fold to 9.8-fold; P <.01) and the peak plasma concentration 1.6-fold (P <.01) compared with placebo.
The mean terminal half-life of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> was prolonged from 1.6 to 6.2 hours (ie, 3.7-fold; range, 1.5-fold to 9.3-fold; P <.001) by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> .
The suppression of <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> production after inhalation of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> was significantly increased by <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> as compared with placebo, as shown by a 43% reduction in the area under the plasma <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentration-time curve from 0.5 to 10 hours (P <.001) and a 12% decrease in the <START:DRUG> cortisol <END> concentration measured 23 hours after administration of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> , at 8 am (P <.05).
 <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> markedly increased systemic exposure to inhaled <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> , probably by inhibiting the cytochrome P4503A4-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> during both the first-pass and the elimination phases.
Evaluation of potential <START:DRUG> losartan <END> - <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> drug interactions in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 substrate, has a narrow therapeutic index and nonlinear pharmacokinetics.
Therefore there is the potential for significant concentration-related adverse effects when <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> is coadministered with other CYP2C9 substrates.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , an antihypertensive agent, is also a substrate for CYP2C9.
Our objective was to assess the effects of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and the effects of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> in a healthy population of volunteers.
A prospective, randomized, 3-period crossover study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> alone, <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> in combination with <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , and <START:DRUG> losartan <END> alone.
Each treatment was given for 10 days with a 3-week washout period between treatments.
On day 10, plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and plasma and urine concentrations of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and its active carboxylic-acid metabolite <START:DRUG> e3174 <END> were measured to determine steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> .
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> increased the mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> by 17% (355 +/- 220 ng x h/mL versus 427 +/- 177 ng x h/mL; P =.1), but this difference was not statistically significant.
In the 14 CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects, the mean AUC(0-24) of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> was increased by 29% (284 +/- 84 ng x h/mL versus 402 +/- 128 ng x h/mL; P =.008).
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> significantly reduced the AUC(0-24) of <START:DRUG> e3174 <END> by 63% (1254 +/- 256 ng x h/mL versus 466 +/- 174 ng x h/mL; P =.0001) and the formation clearance of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> to <START:DRUG> e3174 <END> (1.91 +/- 0.8 mL/h per kilogram versus 0.62 +/- 0.4 mL/h per kilogram; P =.0001).
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , a CYP2C9 substrate, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> inhibited the CYP2C9-mediated conversion of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> to <START:DRUG> e3174 <END> .
Effect of coadministration of <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , and <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> .
OBJECTIVE: Pharmacokinetic interactions are expected when human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are coadministered because many are both substrates for and inhibitors of CYP3A4.
The goal of this model-based pharmacokinetic analysis was to describe the differences observed in <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> pharmacokinetics among treatment arms in the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG) study protocol 398 and to propose mechanisms to account for them.
METHODS: One hundred seventy-six HIV-positive subjects receiving 1200 mg <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> twice daily as part of AACTG protocol 398 were included in the pharmacokinetic study.
All patients also received background medications <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> , adefovir dipivoxil, and <START:DRUG> abacavir <END> and, depending on the study arm, placebo or one of the following protease inhibitors: <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , or <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> .
A population pharmacokinetic model was fitted to a total of 565 <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> concentration measurements.
The blood samples for concentration measurements were drawn at week 2 (12-hour pharmacokinetic study, approximately 7 samples per study; 46 patients) and at week 24 (6-hour pharmacokinetic study, approximately 5 samples per study; 10 patients).
In addition, samples were collected at 1 or more follow-up visits (population pharmacokinetic study, 1 to 3 occasions per patient; 150 patients).
The absolute magnitude of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> intrinsic clearance suggests that CYP3A4 inhibition by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> is balanced by enzymatic induction in the presence of the background drug(s), most likely <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> .
Results and Conclusion: <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> intrinsic clearance was significantly reduced relative to placebo by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> (-41%) and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> (-54%) but not by <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> intrinsic clearance apparently increases by more than 30% between weeks 2 and 24, possibly because of the time course of CYP3A4 induction.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> metabolism by <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> in patients with schizophrenia: a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interaction.
The effect of <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> on the steady-state plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH- <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> ) was evaluated in 10 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Patients stabilized on <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> (4-6 mg/day) received additional <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (20 mg/day) to treat concomitant depression.
One patient dropped out after 1 week due to the occurrence of akathisia associated with markedly increased plasma <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> concentrations.
During the second week of adjunctive therapy, two patients developed Parkinsonian symptoms, which were controlled with anticholinergic medication.
This interaction may lead to toxic plasma <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> concentrations.
In addition to careful clinical observation, monitoring plasma <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> levels may be of value in patients given adjunctive therapy with <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> .
In the other subjects, mean plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> increased during <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> administration from 12 +/- 9 ng/mL at baseline to 56 +/- 31 at week 4 (p < 0.001), while the levels of 9-OH- <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> were not significantly affected.
After 4 weeks of combined treatment, the levels of the active moiety (sum of the concentrations of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> and 9-OH- <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> ) increased by 75% (range, 9-204%, p < 0.01) compared with baseline.
The mean plasma <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> /9-OH- <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> ratio also increased significantly.
These findings indicate that <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 and a less potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, reduces the clearance of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> by inhibiting its 9-hydroxylation or alternative metabolic pathways.
Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> and its interaction with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
The present study was conducted to characterize the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> , a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and to investigate a possible pharmacokinetic interaction with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
In a randomized, two-way crossover study, 10 healthy male subjects received treatments A and B. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of 62.5 mg <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> on day 1 followed by 62.5 mg twice daily for 5.5 days.
Treatment B consisted of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> (62.5 mg twice daily) for 5.5 days plus concomitant <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (200 mg once daily) for 6 days.
Plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> and its three metabolites were measured on days 1 and 7 of treatment A and on day 6 of treatment B. "
Upon multiple dosing, the exposure to <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> was reduced by 33% without change in tmax and t(1/2).
Exposure to the metabolites was low and represented less than 25% of that to <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> both after single and multiple doses.
The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> are consistent with the phenomenon of auto-induction.
 <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> was absorbed and eliminated with a tmax of 4.5 h (range 3.5-6.0 h) and a t(1/2) of 5.4 h (95% CI; 4.5, 6.6).
Concomitant administration of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> increased the Cmax and AUC of <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> 2.1- (95% CI; 1.5, 2.7) and 2.3-fold (95% CI; 1.8, 2.9), respectively.
In the presence of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , formation of the metabolites was inhibited.
In the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors, <START:DRUG> bosentan <END> concentrations may be increased 2-fold.
The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> .
To examine the stereoselective disposition of <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> and to evaluate the role of CYP2D6 in <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> pharmacokinetics in humans.
Eight healthy volunteers (six extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2D6 and two poor metabolizers) received a single 8 mg oral dose of rac- <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> either given alone or following administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> 50 mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study.
Plasma concentrations of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-enantiomers of <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> were determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Stereoselective elimination of <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer.
CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> in humans.
In extensive metabolizers, mean Cmax was greater (12.55+/-1.51 ng ml-1vs 5.38+/-0.44 ng ml-1) and CLoral was lower (0.49+/-0.08 l h-1 kg-1vs 1.07+/-0.15 l h-1 kg-1) for (S)-(+)- than for (R)-(-)- <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> (P<0.005).
For (S)-(+)- <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> , administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94+/-1.51 (P<0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22+/-0.03 l h-1 kg-1 (P<0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0+/-2.0 h to 29.3+/-2.0 h (P<0.001).
Administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)- <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P<0.005).
In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> resulted in a slight increase in CLoral.
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> hydroxylation is inhibited by a single dose of <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> in homozygotic EM genotype for CYP2C19.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and its metabolites in healthy subjects were evaluated to determine if a single dose of <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> inhibited CYP2C19 activity.
Sixteen volunteers, of whom eight were extensive metabolizers (EM) and eight were poor metabolizers for CYP2C19, participated in two studies.
Venous blood samples were collected for 24 h after oral ingestion of 40 mg <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> with or without 300 mg <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> coadministration.
The pharmacokinetic change of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphone and 5-hydroxyomeprazole concentrations were assessed to test for an interaction between <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> .
There was a significant decrease in Cmax and AUC of 5-hydroxyomeprazole in PMs but no significant changes were seen in the results for <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphone AUCs.
A single dose of <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> resulted in significant suppression of CYP2C19 activity in EMs.
We conclude that physicians prescribing <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> should pay attention to its pharmacokinetic interactions even on the first day of coadministration with CYP2C19 substrates.
The coadministration of <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> in EMs approximately doubled the mean AUC (from 1834 to 3760 ng ml(-1) h) and C(max) (from 987 to 1649 ng ml(-1)) of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , and increased the AUC of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphone without changing AUC ratio of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> to <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphone.
 <START:DRUG> moclobemide <END> coadministration more than doubled the AUC ratio of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> to 5-hydroxyomeprazole (from 2.5 to 5.3) in EMs, too.
Effect of a short-term in vitro exposure to the marine toxin <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on viability, tumor necrosis factor-alpha , matrix metalloproteinase-9 and superoxide anion release by rat neonatal microglia
Background
The excitatory amino acid <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , a glutamate and kainic acid analog, is the causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans.
No studies to our knowledge have investigated the potential contribution to short-term neurotoxicity of the brain microglia, a cell type that constitutes circa 10% of the total glial population in the brain.
We tested the hypothesis that a short-term in vitro exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , might lead to the activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of the putative neurotoxic mediators tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinases-2 and-9 (MMP-2 and -9) and superoxide anion (O 2 -).
Results
 In vitro, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [10 μM-1 mM] was significantly neurotoxic to primary cerebellar granule neurons.
Although neonatal rat microglia expressed ionotropic glutamate GluR4 receptors, exposure during 6 hours to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [10 μM-1 mM] had no significant effect on viability.
By four hours, LPS (10 ng/mL) stimulated an increase in TNF-α mRNA and a 2,233 % increase in TNF-α protein In contrast, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> (1 mM) induced a slight rise in TNF-α expression and a 53 % increase (p < 0.01) of immunoreactive TNF-α protein.
Furthermore, though less potent than LPS, a 4-hour treatment with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> (1 mM) yielded a 757% (p < 0.01) increase in MMP-9 release, but had no effect on MMP-2.
Finally, while PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) stimulated O 2 - generation was elevated in 6 hour LPS-primed microglia, a similar pretreatment with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> (1 mM) did not prime O 2 - release.
Conclusions
To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , at in vitro concentrations that are toxic to neuronal cells, can trigger a release of statistically significant amounts of TNF-α and MMP-9 by brain microglia.
These observations are of considerable pathophysiological significance because <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> activates rat microglia several days after in vivo administration.
Background
Microglia are leukocytes derived outside the central nervous system in the bone marrow, from where they enter the circulation as monocytes and migrate into the brain during late embryonic life establishing permanent residency [ 1 ].
Two different phenotypic forms of microglia are known: the activated but nonphagocytic microglia, which play a role in inflammatory pathologies, and the reactive or phagocytic microglia which participate actively in trauma, infection and neuronal degeneration [ 2 ].
In vivo as well as in vitro administration of LPS rapidly and potently activates rat adult and neonatal microglia (for review see Ref.
[ 3 ]).
Accompanying both adult and neonatal microglia activation by LPS [ 4 ] is a concomitant release of numerous secretory products (for review see Ref.
[ 3 ]) that include tissue plasminogen activator [ 5 ], reactive oxygen species such as O 2 - [ 6 , 7 ], cytokines like TNF-α [ 7 , 8 ] and proteases, in particular MMP-9 [ 7 , 9 ], in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
These mediators have been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial injury [ 10 ], neuronal degeneration [ 3 , 11 , 12 ] that could potentially affect neurodevelopment in the immature brain.
Exposure to the marine toxin <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , an excitotoxic amino acid structurally similar to kainic acid and to the neurotransmitter glutamic acid, has been shown to lead to amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, a condition that can lead to death in extreme cases [ 13 ].
Currently, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US.
Food and Drug Administration has included amnesic shellfish poisoning as one of the " ...five recognized fish poisoning syndromes in the United States...
", together with paralytic, neurotoxic, diarrhetic and ciguatera fish poisoning (FDA website:  ) [ 14 ].
Recent behavioral toxicity studies in rodents, have confirmed that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> is a very rapid and potent neurotoxin in newborn rats, at doses far lower than in adult animals [ 15 - 17 ].
Even though hippocampal pyramidal neurons and mossy fiber terminals appear to be selectively targeted in vivo by <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in rat [ 18 ] and cynomolgus monkey brain [ 19 ], recently <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was shown to affect glutamate uptake by astrocytes in vitro and " ...thus produced neurotoxicity...
" [ 20 ].
Of interest is the fact that no studies to our knowledge have investigated the potential contribution of brain microglia to neonatal neurotoxicity after a short-term exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [ 21 ].
The possibility that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> may activate neonatal microglia both in vitro and in vivo is suggested by recent observations with kainic acid, a <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and glutamate analog that can induce upregulation of neonatal microglia scavenger receptor mRNA [ 22 ] and tissue plasminogen activator release [ 23 ].
The putative molecular explanation for these observations has been that kainic acid activates the ionotropic <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate GluR4 subunit which has recently been shown to be expressed by activated microglia following transient forebrain ischemia in vivo [ 24 ].
Because this subunit of the <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptor has affinity for <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [ 25 - 27 ], we hypothesized that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> might activate neonatal microglia in vitro and lead to concomitant mediator release [ 21 ].
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a short-term in vitro exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> might activate rat neonatal microglia and cause mediator release.
Using LPS, which we have previously shown is a rapid and potent in vitro activator of neonatal microglia [ 7 ] as our positive control, we focused our investigation on three microglia mediators which are released upon LPS activation, namely TNF-α, MMP-9 and O 2 - [ 7 ].
Our present study demonstrates that in contrast to LPS, during a 6 hour in vitro exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , neonatal rat microglia release small, but statistically significant amounts of TNF-α and MMP-9.
Furthermore our observations suggest that in vivo, brain microglia as well as the mediators released by this cell type in brain tissue, would appear to play a limited role in the rapid and potent <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> neurotoxicity observed in neonatal rats after a short-term administration of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> .
Results
Determination of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> by electrospray mass spectrometry
The presence of undegraded <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in both stock solution (12.5 mM) and dilutions prepared with LPS-free water was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry prior to the experiments.
As shown for the 12.5 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> stock solution in Fig. 1A , the dominate ion in the spectrum was m/z 312.2 which is the pseudomolecular ion [M+H] + of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> .
Also present in the spectrum were m/z 334.2, the sodium adduct [M+Na] + of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , m/z 623.3, the dimer [2M+H] + of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , and m/z 645.4 [2M+Na] + , the sodium adduct of the dimer.
The dimer was formed in the gas phase due to the high concentration of the sample.
Mass spectra for dilution of 2.5, 0.25 and 0.025 mM also showed as the dominate ion m/z 312, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [M+H] + (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 1B , for the lowest <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> concentration used in our studies, namely 0.0025 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , although background noise dominated the sample, m/z 312.2, the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [M+H] + was clearly seen in the spectrum.

(A) The electrospray mass spectrometry spectrum of 12.5 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> shows that the dominate ion in the spectrum is m/z 312.2, the pseudomolecular ion [M+H+] of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , demonstrating that undegraded <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was present in the 12.5 mM stock solution; (B) The electrospray mass spectrometry spectrum of 0.0025 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , the highest dilution used in the experiments, also shows the presence of undegraded <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> .
Immunofluorescent visualization of CD11b/c and glutamate receptor subunit GluR4 in rat neonatal microglia
It has recently been reported that transient forebrain ischemia leads to the expression of the inotropic <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit in vivo [ 24 ] in rat neonatal microglia.
In order to ascertain that under our experimental conditions rat neonatal microglia expressed the GluR4 subunit, we studied the expression of the <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> receptor GluR4 by immunohistochemistry.
The top left photo in Fig. 2 shows a bright field, phase contrast view of microglia that were incubated in the absence of the primary antibodies against GluR4 and CD11b/c.
Note that the microglia are irregular in shape and show numerous elongated processes extending from the bodies of the cells.
In addition, numerous vesicular structures are present in the cytoplasm of the microglia.
The top right photo shows the same microglia when viewed using the FITC filter configuration.
Note that the vesicular structures exhibit an intense autofluorescence, but that little or no fluorescence is evident over most of the microglia cell bodies or in the elongated processes.
Interestingly, this same pattern of autofluorescence was evident when the microglia were viewed with the TRITC filter configuration (not shown).
The middle left photo shows a bright field, phase contrast view of microglia that had been labeled with the antibodies against the glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit and the leukocyte marker CD11b/c.
Again, the microglia are irregular in shape, with elongated processes extending from the cell bodies and numerous vesicles present in the cytoplasm.
The middle right photo (green) shows this same field when viewed using the FITC filter configuration.
As evident, the microglia not only contain fluorescent vesicles, but also exhibit a prominent speckled pattern of fluorescence over the cell bodies and the elongated processes.
The fact that this speckled pattern of labeling is not present in the samples that were incubated without the primary GluR4 antibody (compare with top right photo) strongly indicates that the speckled pattern represents specific labeling of GluR4 subunit.
The lower left photo shows that these same microglia exhibited intense labeling of CD11b/c (red), which confirms that the microglia are of leukocytic origin.
In the bottom right photo the images showing the GluR4 and the CD11b/c labeling have been superimposed (yellow).
Together, these results indicate that GluR4 glutamate receptor subunits are present on the cell surface and that these cells are, in fact, microglia.

Effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on cerebellar granule cell and rat neonatal microglia viability
 <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> has been reported to be neurotoxic to neuronal tissue in vitro in concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 20 mM [ 28 - 33 ].
In order to determine a concentration of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> that was neurotoxic in vitro during a 6 hour exposure, we investigated the concentration-dependent effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on cerebellar granule neurons using the WST-1 viability assay.
This assay measures cell viability as a function of cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells to formazan.
As shown in Fig. 3C and 3D the viability of primary cerebellar granule cells exposed for up to 6 hours to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [10 μM-1 mM] was significantly affected (P < 0.05).
In contrast to our observations with cerebellar granule neurons, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> even at the highest neurotoxic concentration tested in our in vitro study, namely [1 mM] did not affect microglia viability during a 6 hour exposure (Fig 3A and 3B ).
Because 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was clearly neurotoxic in our studies, this concentration was selected for all in vitro experiments with microglia.
LPS (10 ng/ml) did not affect microglia viability in vitro during a 6 hour exposure (data not shown).

Effect of LPS and <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on TNF-α mRNA expression from rat neonatal microglia
Activation of microglia has been shown to cause the release of cytokines such as TNF-α [ 7 , 8 ].
As shown in Fig. 4A , stimulation of microglia with LPS [10 ng/ml] resulted in a time-dependent increase in TNF-α mRNA expression relative to controls as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at the linear range of amplification (20 cycles).
Without LPS treatment (control), TNF-α mRNA expression was undetectable.
As shown in Fig. 5 , the relative levels of TNF-α expression increased 4.5 fold by 1 hour and remained elevated throughout the 6 hour observation period.
In contrast to the marked increase in TNF-α expression induced by LPS, as shown in Fig. 4B , <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] induced a less potent yet time-dependent increase in TNF-α mRNA expression as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR over the linear range of amplification (25 cycles).
As shown in Fig. 5 , although not statistically significant, the relative levels of TNF-α expression increased two-fold by 4 hours and remained elevated during the next two hours.

Neonatal rat brain microglia (2.8–5 × 10 6 cells/culture dish) were treated with (A) LPS [10 ng/mL] or (B) <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] for 1 to 6 hours.

Effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on rat neonatal microglia release of TNF-α
In order to determine if the increase in TNF-α mRNA after a short term stimulation with either <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] or LPS [10 ng/mL] led to a concomitant production of TNF-α protein, the cell-free media corresponding to the same microglia used for TNF-α mRNA analysis were assayed with an ultrasensitive rat-specific ELISA.
As expected and shown in Fig. 6 , LPS [10 ng/mL] stimulated microglia time-dependent TNF-α release: by 4 hours TNF-α levels increased 2,233 % and were 298.7 ± 3.9 pg/mL (LPS-treated, n = 4) vs. 12.8 ± 2.6 pg/mL (untreated controls, n = 8), P < 0.01.
In contrast to LPS, levels of immunoreactive TNF-α in the tissue culture media increased 53.3 % 4 hours after microglia were treated with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] and were 28.2 ± 3.6 pg/mL ( <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -treated, n = 6) vs. 18.4 ± 1.99 pg/mL (untreated controls, n = 10), P < 0.01.
Interestingly, the 4 hour time point corresponded to the highest level of TNF-α mRNA expression shown in Fig. 5 .

Effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on rat neonatal microglia release of MMP-2 and MMP-9
We have recently shown that a stimulation of microglia with LPS will lead to both TNF-α generation and MMP-9 production, a mediator that has been reported to be toxic to neuronal tissue [ 7 ].
As shown in Fig. 7 , when microglia were stimulated with LPS [10 ng/mL], an increase in MMP-9 and MMP-2 release was observed: by 4 hours MMP-9 inverse O.D.
levels increased 2,100 % and were respectively 0.198 ± 0.009 (LPS-treated, n = 3) vs. 0.009 ± 0.001 (untreated controls, n = 3), P < 0.01.
In contrast to LPS, a 757 % increase in MMP-9 levels was observed in the tissue culture media 4 hours after microglia were treated with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM]: inverse O.D.
levels were respectively 0.06 ± 0.01 ( <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -treated, n = 3) vs. 0.007 ± 0.001 (untreated controls, n = 3), P < 0.01.
 <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] had no effect on MMP-2 release.

Effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on rat neonatal microglia release of O 2 -
We have shown that while unprimed naive microglia release low levels of O 2 -, pretreatment with LPS results in an increase of PMA-stimulated O 2 - [ 7 ].
As is depicted in Fig. 8A , when microglia were pretreated for 6 hours with LPS [10 ng/mL], there was, as expected, an increase in PMA [1 μM]-stimulated O 2 - production: 6.5 ± 0.9 nmoles/2 hours (LPS-pretreated, n = 3) vs. 1.7 ± 0.07 nmoles/2 hours (untreated controls, n = 3), P < 0.01.
In contrast, a 6 hour pretreatment of microglia with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM], yielded no statistically significant increase in PMA [1 μM]-stimulated O 2 - generation: 2.97 ± 0.44 nmoles/2 hours ( <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> pretreated, n = 3) vs. 1.7 ± 0.07 nmoles/2 hours (untreated controls, n = 3).
Furthermore, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> did not affect PMA [1 μM]-stimulated O 2 - generation from 6 hour LPS-pretreated microglia: 6.5 ± 0.9 nmoles/2 hours (LPS-pretreated, n = 3) vs. 6.26 ± 0.4 nmoles/2 hours (LPS + <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> pretreated, n = 3).
Finally, as shown in Fig. 8B , though not statistically significant, a 2 hour stimulation with increasing concentrations of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and PMA [1 μM], reduced O 2 - generation from 6 hours LPS-pretreated microglia: 4.16 ± 0.58 nmoles/2 hours ( <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> [1 mM] + PMA [1 μM], n = 3) vs 6.5 ± 1.0 nmoles/2 hours (untreated controls, n = 3).

Discussion
Although <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> 's excitotoxicity to adult neuronal tissue in humans, rats, mice and monkeys is well documented (for review see Ref.
[ 21 ]), a growing body of research also suggests that there might be increased vulnerability during the neonatal period [ 15 - 17 ].
The fact that the blood-brain barrier is incomplete [ 34 ], provides a putative explanation as to why neonates and fetal mice in utero appear to be more sensitive to neurotoxins like <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> than adult animals [ 35 - 37 ].
Although microglia contribute to circa 10% of the total glial cell population in the central nervous system (For review see Ref.
[ 38 ]), to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the potential role of microglia in mediating the neurotoxic effects of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in the developing rat brain.
We have recently hypothesized that the marine toxin <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> might affect the developing brain by directly activating neonatal rat microglia and causing a subsequent release of potentially neurotoxic mediators [ 21 ].
Prior to testing our hypothesis experimentally, and determining whether <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> had the potential to directly activate rat neonatal microglia in vitro, we thought that it was of critical importance to establish that: (1) the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> preparation used in these experiments was stable, (2) rat neonatal microglia isolated by our methodology expressed the <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit which has been observed in activated rat microglia in vivo [ 24 ] and, (3) to confirm that the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> concentration selected for our in vitro studies with rat neonatal microglia was one that was clearly toxic to neuronal cells in vitro after a short-term exposure.
Although it has been reported that the solubility of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in water is approximately 7.6 g/L (24.4 mM) [ 39 ], rapid and complete dissolution of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was only consistently observed in our laboratory when preparing a stock <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> solution of 12.5 mM in certified LPS-free water.
To rule out the possibility that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> might have degraded as a consequence of either our preparative method or the subsequent freezing (-80°C) and thawing of the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> stock solution, electrospray mass spectrometry was run on both the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> stock solution (12.5 mM) and the dilutions prepared prior to the experiments.
Our electrospray mass spectrometry results clearly showed that undegraded <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was present, demonstrating the stability of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in the aqueous solutions that had been frozen at -80°C and thawed prior to use in the experiments.
Interestingly, our observations complement those recently reported on <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> 's stability in saline solutions [ 40 ].
The ionotropic <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptor GluR4 subunit has been shown to be expressed by activated rat adult microglia in vivo following transient forebrain ischemia [ 24 ] and also in vitro by rat neonatal microglia [ 41 ].
Because it is well established that <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptors bind <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> with high affinity in the nanomolar range [ 25 ], we investigated the presence of GluR4 in rat neonatal microglia used in our in vitro experiments by a dual-labeling indirect immunofluorescence technique.
Our results clearly confirmed that GluR4 was present in the rat neonatal microglia used in our in vitro studies with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , demonstrating that the protocol used in our laboratory to isolate microglia did not appear to affect the presence of the <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptor GluR4 subunits and their colocalization with the CD 11 b/c integrin.
The cytotoxicity of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> to neuronal tissue in vitro has been investigated over a wide range of concentrations, namely at 10 μM with primary cultures of cerebellar neurons [ 30 , 31 ] as well as hippocampal slices [ 33 ], at 100 μM with cultured prenatal rat hippocampal neurons [ 29 ] and at 20 mM with rat lumbar spinal interneurons [ 28 ].
In order to determine a concentration of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> for our in vitro studies that was toxic to cerebellar granule cells after a short-term exposure in our experimental conditions, we completed a viability study using the WST-1 method.
The results of this study demonstrated that even though the highest concentration of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> tested, namely 1 mM, did not affect rat neonatal microglia viability in vitro, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> concentrations as low as 10 μM were clearly cytotoxic to cerebellar granule neurons after a 6 hour exposure.
Because cerebellar granule cells appear to be inherently resistant to the cytotoxic effects of excitatory amino acids and neurotoxicity appears to be " ...facilitated when cellular energy is limited in cultured cerebellar neurons...
" [ 42 ], perhaps manipulating the experimental conditions (e.g. lowering the temperature to 22°C) might have enhanced the intensity of the observed cytotoxicity to cerebellar neurons even further, as was reported recently when cerebellar granule cells were exposed to 10 μM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> for up to 24 hours [ 43 ].
Future work is necessary to determine if similar changes in the experimental conditions might also increase the toxicity of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> to rat neonatal microglia in vitro.
It is interesting to note, however, that in newborn mice a brief local application of 2 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> to the exposed cortical surface led to a massive degeneration of <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> /KA GluR receptor positive Cajal-Retzius neurons [ 44 ], severe impairment of cortical neuronal migration in vivo and malformation of the <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -treated neocortex [ 44 ].
Thus, because 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was clearly toxic to cerebellar granule neurons both in vitro (our current study) and in vivo [ 44 ], we selected 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> for the experiments with rat neonatal microglia reported herein.
Having determined that our <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> preparation was stable and undegraded, that rat neonatal microglia expressed GluR4 in vitro and that 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was toxic to cerebellar granule neurons in vitro but did not affect the viability of rat neonatal microglia, we then investigated whether a short term 1–6 hour exposure to 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> would activate rat neonatal microglia in vitro.
In all our experiments we compared <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> 's effect with that of 10 ng/ml LPS, a potent and rapid microglia activator [ 7 ], to clearly show that rat neonatal microglia were able to become rapidly activated and release mediators, i.e. TNF-α, MMP-9 and O 2 - upon short-term in vitro treatment.
We have recently reported on the kinetics of LPS activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of TNF-α protein, MMP-9 and O 2 - [ 7 ].
These three microglia mediators are currently thought to participate in neuronal and glial injury in vivo [ 10 , 45 ] .
TNF-α is a cytokine that can mediate myelin and oligodendrocyte damage in vitro [ 10 ] and thought to play a key role in central nervous system pathologies [ 3 ].
In vitro E. coli LPS can trigger rat neonatal microglia to rapidly activate TNF-α gene expression and subsequent protein release [ 46 ] in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
Although in vitro exposure of rat neonatal microglia to 10 ng/ml LPS resulted, as expected, in a rapid elevation of both TNF-α gene expression and protein release, we observed only a small effect of 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on TNF-α gene expression.
Interestingly, the slight rise in TNF-α expression yielded a 53 % (p < 0.01) increase of TNF-α protein release 4 hours after stimulation with 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> .
Although we feel it may be premature to speculate on the putative pathophysiological significance of this increase in immunoreactive TNF-α, the fact that TNF-α can induce MMP-9 expression in macrophages [ 47 ], suggests that TNF-α may play an as yet undetermined role in the mechanism of MMP-9 release observed in our studies.
Futhermore immuno-PCR techniques, which have allowed investigators to study the kinetics of TNF-α release at the femtomolar range [ 48 ], might help to study the kinetics of picomolar microglia TNF-α release triggered by a short-term exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> .
These proposed studies might be of considerable significance in view of the fact that similar amounts of TNF-α release have also been observed after a 2 hour stimulation of rat neonatal microglia with kainic acid, a <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and glutamate analog [ 41 ].
Taken together, our results with <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> as well as those of Noda et al.
[ 41 ]with kainic acid support the recently proposed notion that TNF-α might not be neurotoxic in some situations when the release of this mediator is low, and therefore might not be a necessary requirement for neuronal death involving excitatory amino acids [ 49 ].
Proteases such as MMP-9 [ 9 ], which have been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial injury in vivo in " ...central nervous system diseases...
" [ 50 ] are released by LPS-activated rat neonatal microglia in vitro [ 7 ], by a mechanism that may involve TNF-α [ 47 , 51 ].
Clearly because in our studies 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> stimulated both an increase in TNF-α release, as well as MMP-9, further investigation of a possible relationship between these two events may be important.
Furthermore, though the magnitude of MMP-9 secretion stimulated by <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> was lower than the one observed with LPS, this is the first observation to our knowledge that an excitatory amino acid like <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> is able to trigger MMP-9 release in vitro.
Although at the present time it is difficult to comment on the pathophysiological significance of increased MMP-9 release, it is perhaps noteworthy that increased MMP-9 expression has been correlated with increased apoptosis [ 52 ] and increased microvascular permeability [ 53 ], events possibly involved in the opening of the blood-brain barrier [ 54 ] and potential injury to the brain [ 50 ].
Microglia constitute the main leukocyte-dependent source of reactive oxygen species in the central nervous system [ 55 ].
Since microglia were first shown to release O 2 - [ 6 ] numerous investigations have been undertaken over the past 14 years to characterize agents than can either prime and/or trigger the microglia O 2 - generating system (for review see Ref.
[ 3 ]).
In our current experiments, we observed that 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> did not prime rat neonatal microglia for PMA-stimulated O 2 - release, again in marked contrast with LPS.
Interestingly though, <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> appeared to modulate LPS-primed rat neonatal microglia O 2 - release, suggesting that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> might potentially play a role in the in vivo modulation of activated rat neonatal microglia, and perhaps other leukocytes capable of releasing O 2 -.
In summary, in our experiments the in vitro effect of a 1–6 hour exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on rat neonatal microglia activation and concomitant TNF-α, MMP-9 and O 2 - release was clearly distinct in its magnitude from that observed after exposure to LPS, an agent involved in endotoxic shock and other central nervous pathologies [ 3 ].
Even though this present study was limited to the study of the in vitro effects of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> on three microglia mediators, namely TNF-α, MMP-9 and O 2 -, it provides the first experimental evidence to our knowledge that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , at in vitro concentrations that are toxic to neuronal cells, can trigger a limited activation of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of modest though statistically significant amounts of TNF-α and MMP-9.
Our investigation does not exclude the possibility that in vitro <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> may affect expression of genes and mediators that might support survival of neuronal cells.
Several lines of evidence appear to support this possibility.
Thus, in a recent report ionotropic <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> glutamate receptors were shown to " ...function not only as ion channels but also as cell-surface transducers by means of their interaction with the Src-family non-receptor protein kinase Lyn...
", ultimately leading to " ...expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) messenger RNA " in cerebellar primary culture neurons [ 56 ].
In another study, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was shown to significantly protect cerebellar granule neurons in culture from the neurotoxicity by <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , perhaps " ...through a direct interaction of bFGF and bFGF receptors on the neuronal surface...
" [ 32 ].
Interestingly, because rat neonatal microglia have been shown to express BDNF [ 57 ] and bFGF [ 58 ], and in view of the fact that LPS can affect BDNF gene expression in rat neonatal microglia cells [ 59 ], experiments are currently underway in our laboratory to determine if <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> may affect neonatal rat microglia expression of both BDNF and bFGF.
However, we do not rule out the possibility that growth factors other than BDNF and bFGF could be released by <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -stimulated neonatal microglia cells and play a role in neuroprotection from excitotoxic injury.
Conclusions
Our present results provide the first experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that a direct interaction of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> with rat neonatal microglia in vitro, leads to the release of small but statistically significant amounts of two potentially neurotoxic mediators, namely TNF-α and MMP-9 after a short-term in vitro exposure.
These observations are of considerable significance if future research demonstrates that higher levels of TNF-α and MMP-9 are generated by neonatal rat microglia as a result of either (1) a synergistic interaction between <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> " ...when in association with subtoxic concentrations of excitatory amino acids...
" a combination that has been shown to increase the neurotoxicity of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> to primary cultures of cerebellar neurons [ 31 ] or (2) an increase in the time of exposure to <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , as we have reported is the case with LPS [ 7 ].
The fact that <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> has been shown to activate rat microglia several days after in vivo administration [ 60 ]clearly raises this latter possibility.
An understanding of the potential neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective effects of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in neonatal rats will ultimately lead to a better understanding of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> 's effect in neonatal human development.
This concept is supported by the established fact that glutamate receptors are highly conserved between mammals [ 26 ].
Ultimately studies contributing to the characterization of the early biochemical as well as cellular events subsequent to an intoxication with the marine toxin <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> will yield new insights for the rationale development of novel therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of amnesic shellfish poisoning.

Electrospray mass spectrometry of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> 
The presence of undegraded <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> in the stock solution (12.5 mM) and dilutions prepared with LPS-free water was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry prior to the experiments.
Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed in the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, School of Chemical Sciences, University of Illinois.

The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole <START:DRUG> propionic acid <END> ( <START:DRUG> AMPA <END> ) glutamate-4 receptor subunit (GluR4) and the integrin CD11b/c were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using a dual labeling procedure.
Rat neonatal microglia on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized in -20°C methanol for 10 min, and then blocked with 10% goat serum in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 25°C for 5 min.
The samples were incubated for 45 min at 37°C in PBS containing the primary antibodies, a rabbit anti-rat GluR4 at a 1:50 dilution, and a mouse anti-rat CD11b/c (OX-42) at a 1:100 dilution.
Control samples were incubated in the same manner except the primary antibodies were omitted from the solution.
The samples were rinsed quickly in PBS and then incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in PBS containing the secondary antibodies, a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:50 and a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:400.

Isolation and culture of rat neonatal microglia
All experiments were performed with adherence to the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the use of experimental animals and with protocols approved by Midwestern University's Research and Animal Care Committee.
To isolate rat neonatal microglia, cerebral cortices of 1–2 day-old Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) were surgically removed and placed in cold DMEM + 10% FBS +120 U/ml P and 12 μg/ml S, the meninges carefully removed, and brain tissue minced and dissociated with trypsin-EDTA at 36°C for 3–5 min.
The mixed glial cell suspension was plated in either 75- or 162-cm 2 vented cell culture flasks with DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS +120 U/ml P + 12 μg/ml S and grown in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 36°C for 12–14 days.
On day 14 and every 3–4 days thereafter, microglia were detached using an orbital shaker (150 rpm, 0.5 hours, 36°C, 5% CO 2 ), centrifuged (400 × g, 25 min, 4°C), and microglia number and viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
Microglia were characterized as described earlier [ 7 ].
Depending on the particular experimental protocol (see below), microglia averaging > than 95% viability were plated in either 60 mm × 15 mm polystyrene cell culture dishes, 96-well cell culture clusters, or 24-well cell culture clusters, with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 μg/ml S, and placed in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 36°C 18–24 hours prior to the experiments.
Primary culture of rat cerebellar granule neurons
Primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from the cerebella of 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats.
Cerebella were dissected and processed as described elsewhere [ 61 ].
The dissociated cells were grown in a serum-free Neurobasal-A medium with B27 supplement (10 ml/500 ml) [ 62 ], and in the presence of 25 mM KCl (Sigma).
The cells were maintained in poly- <START:DRUG> l-Lysine <END> -treated (10 ug/ml; Sigma) 96-well plates (60,000 cells/0.1 ml Neurobasal A medium/well), at 37°C in an incubator with 95% air/5% CO 2 .
This method results in a culture consisting of neuronal precursors that differentiate into neurons; the differentiated cultures were used for experiments after 10 days.
Experimental protocol to determine the viability of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -treated rat neonatal microglia or cerebellar granule neurons
A colorimetric assay for the quantitation of cell viability, based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-[3-(4- <START:DRUG> iodophenyl <END> )-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]1,3-benzene disulfonate) (slightly red) to formazan (red) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells was utilized for these studies.
Briefly, rat neonatal microglia or cerebellar granule cells (60,000 cells / well) were plated in LPS-free 96-well cell culture clusters 24 hours prior to the experiments in either 0.1 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 μg/ml S (microglia), or 0.1 ml serum-free Neurobasal A medium with B27 supplement (cerebellar granule neurons).
Thereafter each well received 4 μl of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> (0.01 μM – 1 mM final concentration) or vehicle (LPS-free water) and 10 μl of the tetrazolium salt WST-obtained from Roche Diagnostics Gmbh (Mannheim, Germany).
Plates were incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 36°C and the reduction of the WST-1 reagent to formazan was measured repeatedly after the addition of the WST-1 reagent, at either 415 nM (neurons) or 450 nM (microglia), with a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader.
Experimental protocol to determine the effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on rat neonatal microglia release of TNF-α, MMP-2, MMP-9 and O 2 -
To study the time-dependent effects of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on the generation of TNF-α, MMP-2 and MMP-9, rat neonatal microglia (2.8–5 × 10 6 cells/60 mm × 15 mm polystyrene cell culture dish) were treated with (1) 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , (2) LPS-free water used as a vehicle for <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> or (3) 10 ng/ml LPS in a final volume of 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 μg/ml S and incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 36°C for 1 to 6 h.
Upon termination of the experiments, cell-free supernatants from each culture dish were assayed for TNF-α, MMP-2 and MMP-9, while rat neonatal microglia were processed for RNA isolation and RT-PCR.
For the O 2 - assay, rat neonatal microglia (250,000 cells/ 24-well cell culture clusters) were treated with (1) 1 mM <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , (2) LPS-free water used as a vehicle for <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> or (3) 10 ng/ml LPS in a final volume of 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS + 120 U/ml P + 12 μg/ml S and incubated in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 36°C for 1 to 6 hours.
Thereafter the media was removed, 1 ml warm HBSS was added, and rat neonatal microglia were stimulated with PMA [1 μM] for 120 min and O 2 - production was assayed as described below.
Experimental protocol to determine the effect of <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> and LPS on rat neonatal microglia TNF-α expression: RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total rat neonatal microglia RNA was isolated with TRI reagent purchased from Molecular Research Center, Inc.
(Cincinnati, OH).
The RT-PCR were performed in the same sample tube using gene-specific primers obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA), as described below, and the Superscript one-step kit obtained from Gibco-BRL (Grand Island, NY).
Briefly, first strand cDNA was made using 0.25 μg of RNA, Superscript II H-reverse transcriptase, antisense gene-specific primers and conditions of 30 min at 50°C.
Samples were denatured at 94°C for 2 min, and PCR was performed for various cycle numbers to ensure linear amplification.
The PCR cycling conditions consisted of a denaturation step at 94°C for 30 s, an annealing step at 54°C (S12) or 60°C (TNF-α), an extension step at 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
The 50 μl samples contained 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.2 mM <START:DRUG> <START:DRUG> magnesium <END> Sulfate <END> .
Platinum ® taq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 μM of each gene specific primer.
The primers for rat TNF-α, were designed using the DNASTAR Lasergene software (Madison, WI) and the rat TNF-α cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number NM 012675), and are sense (bp 127 – 150):5'-GGG GCC ACC ACG CTC TTC TGT CTA-3' and antisense (bp 285 – 307): 5'-CCT CCG CTT GGT TTG CTA CG-3', and generate a 181 bp cDNA product.
The primers for rat constitutively expressed ribosomal S12, were sense:5'-ACG TCA ACA CTG CTC TAC A-3' and antisense:5'-CTT TGC CAT AGT CCT TAA C-3' and generate a 303 bp cDNA product as previously described [ 63 ].
Controls for RT-PCR included samples without the enzyme reverse transcriptase and samples without template.
The PCR reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1.5 % agarose gels, visualized with SYBR ® Gold nucleic acid staining (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR), photographed, scanned and digitized with the UN-SCAN-IT™ gel automated digitizing system from Silk Scientific (Orem, UT).
The relative amounts of TNF-α expression as determined by RT-PCR were normalized to S12 levels using methods similar to those previously described by others [ 64 ].
Assays for TNF-α and O 2 -.
TNF-α
Immunoreactive TNF-α in cell-free media supernates was determined using an ultrasensitive rat-specific ELISA for TNF-α purchased from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA) with a detection limit of 0.7 pg/ml.
Results are expressed as pg/ml.
O 2 - : O 2 - generation was determined by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of FCC [ 7 ].
Briefly, O 2 - release from microglia was measured in the presence of FCC (50 μM) and HBSS, with or without SOD (700 Units).
All experimental treatments were run in triplicate and in a final volume of 1 ml.
Changes in FCC absorbance were measured at 550 nm using a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer and O 2 - generation expressed in nmol by employing the molecular extinction coefficient of 21.0 × 10 3 M -1 cm -1 .
SDS-PAGE gelatinase zymography for MMP-2 and MMP-9 analysis
Following incubation with LPS or <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> , MMP expression was analyzed in the harvested media of cultured rat neonatal microglia.
As the rat neonatal microglia cultures were normalized for cell number, equal volumes of harvested media obtained from each condition were analyzed.
Briefly, 10 μl of each sample were electrophoresed at 4°C and under non-denaturing conditions using a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.05% gelatin.
The gels were incubated for 1 hour in a 2.5% Triton X-100 solution and then washed twice with water (20 min each).
The gels were then incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM CaCl 2 .
A duplicate negative control gel was incubated as described above but in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM EDTA instead of CaCl 2 .
The gels were fixed for 1 hour in 40% methanol /7% <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> and then stained in Coomassie Blue Solution (Sigma), followed by destaining in 10% methanol, 7% <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> .
MMP activity was visualized as clear bands against a blue background.
Gelatin-containing zymograms are typically used to detect MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa) and their identification is based on molecular weight.
Relative clearing of each sample was quantitated by determining the inverse optical density units using the NIH Image software package (version 1.60).
Values are represented as the mean ± SE and are presented as inverse optical density.
The value corresponding to background, a region of equal area as that used to measure the cleared bands and of a lane in which no sample was loaded, was subtracted from each sample value.
Statistical analysis of the data
Data were analyzed with the Prism R software package purchased from GraphPad (San Diego, CA.).
One way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test was performed on all sets of data.
LPS or <START:DRUG> domoic acid <END> -treated groups were compared with the vehicle-treated group, shown as 0 or control in the corresponding figures.
Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 and reported in each figure legend.

Effect of <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> (DDC) and <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> on CYP1A2 activity and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> metabolism: an in vitro comparative study with human cDNA-expressed CYP1A2 and liver microsomes.
The aim of the present study was to test the effect of <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> (DDC), which is regarded as a cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 inhibitor, and <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> , an efficient CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 inhibitor, on the activity of human CYP1A2 and the metabolism of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (-N-,-N- and-N-demethylation, and C-- hydroxylation).
The experiment was carried out in vitro using human cDNA-expressed CYP1A2 (Supersomes) and human pooled liver microsomes.
The effects of DDC and <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> were compared to those of <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor).
A comparative in vitro study provides clear evidence that <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> and DDC, applied at concentrations that inhibit the above-mentioned CYP isoforms, potently (as compared to <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> ) inhibit human CYP1A2 and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> metabolism, in particular-N- and-N-demethylation.

In the present study, the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) by DPT was evaluated in human liver microsomes (HLM) and the baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs using a cocktail probe assay.
The Lineweaver-Burke plots for the inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in HLM and baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs were consistent with a competitive type of inhibition.
When a mixture of specific CYP substrates was incubated with DPT in HLM, CYP2C9-catalyzed <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1-hydroxylation were strongly inhibited by DPT, with IC (50) values of 6.3 and 9.2 microM, respectively.
From these results, DPT was characterized to be a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, with K(i) values of 3.5 and 10.8 microM in HLM and 24.9 and 3.5 microM in baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> perazine <END> at therapeutic drug concentrations inhibits human cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) and <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> metabolism--an in vitro study.
The aim of the present study was to estimate the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> perazine <END> , a phenothiazine neuroleptic with <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> structure in a side chain, on human CYP1A2 activity measured as a rate of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> 3-N- and 1-N-demethylation.
Moreover, the influence of <START:DRUG> perazine <END> on other <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> metabolic pathways such as 7-N-demethylation (CYP1A2, CYP2C8/9, CYP3A4) and 8-hydroxylation (CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C8/9) was also determined.
The Dixon analysis showed that in both human liver microsomes and Supersomes CYP1A2 <START:DRUG> perazine <END> potently and to a similar degree inhibited <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> 3-N-demethylation (K(i) = 3.5 microM) and 1-N-demethylation (K(i) = 5 microM).
Hence, taking account of CYP1A2 contribution to the metabolism of endogenous substances (steroids), drugs (xanthine derivatives, <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> , <START:DRUG> propranolol <END> , <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , phenothiazine neuroleptics, <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> ) and carcinogenic compounds, the inhibition of CYP1A2 by <START:DRUG> perazine <END> may be of physiological, pharmacological and toxicological importance.
Perazinemoderately diminished the rate of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> 7-N-demethylation in Supersomes CYP1A2 (K(i) = 11.5 microM) and liver microsomes (K(i) = 20 microM), and attenuated C-8-hydroxylation (K(i) = 15.5 microM) in Supersomes CYP1A2.
On the other hand, <START:DRUG> perazine <END> weakly inhibited <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> C-8-hydroxylation in liver microsomes (K(i) = 98 microM).
About 80% of basal CYP1A2 activity was reduced by the therapeutic concentrations of <START:DRUG> perazine <END> (5-10 microM).
The obtained results show that <START:DRUG> perazine <END> at its therapeutic concentrations is a potent inhibitor of human CYP1A2.
Roles of different CYP enzymes in the formation of specific <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolites by human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> has been considered to be metabolised to 5-hydroxy <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> (M-2), 6-hydroxy <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> (M-3) and N-desisopropyl <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> (M-5) in human liver microsomes by primarily CYP2C9.
To elucidate the contribution of different CYP enzymes on <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolism, we examined the effect of CYP inhibitors and CYP2C-specific monoclonal antibodies on the formation of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolites in human liver microsomes.
Human liver microsomes were incubated with <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> with or without pre-treatment with CYP inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies.
Selective inhibitors of CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> ), CYP3A ( <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) and CYP2C8 ( <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> ) were employed and monoclonal antibodies were against CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8/9/18/19.
According to the amount of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolites produced, the formation of M-3 was found to be major pathway of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolism (the relative contribution was calculated to be more than 80%).
In contrast to previous published work, our results suggest that M-2 and M-5 are formed preferentially by CYP2C9, and that M-3 is mainly formed by CYP3A.
In summary, the results contribute to a better understanding of the drug-drug interaction potential for <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> inhibited the formation of M-2 largely, but had little effect on the formation of M-3.
It also inhibited the formation of M-5.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> markedly inhibited the formation of M-3, but did not inhibit the formation of M-2 and M-5.
 <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> had a moderate inhibitory effect on the formation of all three <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolites.
Monoclonal antibodies against CYP2C9 and CYP2C8/9/18/19 markedly inhibited the formation of M-2 and M-5.
None of monoclonal antibodies showed clear inhibition on the formation of M-3.
The oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> dimemorfan <END> by human cytochrome P450 enzymes.
To characterize the human cytochrome P450 (P450) forms involved in dimemorfanoxidation (DFO), human liver microsomes, and recombinant P450s were investigated.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectral analysis suggested that metabolite (M)1 ( [M + H](+) m/z at 272.200) and M2 ( [M + H](+) m/z at 242.190) were d-3-hydroxymethyl-N-methylmorphinan and d-3-methylmorphinan, respectively.
Kinetic analyses of microsomal DFO showed that the substrate concentration showing a half-maximal velocity (S(50)) of M1 formation was less than that of M2.
Microsomal M1 and M2 formation activities correlated significantly with the CYP2D6 marker, <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation activity.
The M2 formation activity was also correlated with the CYP3A4 marker, <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation activity.
The immunoinhibition-defined P450 contributions indicated the participation of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 in the M1 formation and CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in the M2 formation.
These results indicated the participation of multiple P450 forms in DFO.
Microsomal M1 and M2 formation was most sensitive to the inhibition by a CYP2D6 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , respectively.
Among recombinant P450s, CYP2D6 had the highest intrinsic clearance with a K(m) value of 0.02 mM in forming M1.
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 had the K(m) or S(50) values smaller than those (1 mM) of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in forming M2.
R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> inhibits hydroxylation of S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> by CYP2C9.
 <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> is a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor structurally akin to several <START:DRUG> propionic <END> acid derivatives, such as <START:DRUG> ibuprofen <END> and <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , which are metabolised by CYP2C9.
We report eight subjects who experienced significant elevation of INR while receiving concomitant R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> and <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
The aim of the study is to investigate whether R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> interacts with S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> by inhibition of CYP2C9.
The effect of R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> on S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> hydroxylation was determined by the measurement of S-7-hydroxywarfarin formation in pooled human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYP2C9.
The K(i) values of R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> were estimated to be 959+/-426 microM for human liver microsomes and to be 377+/-92 microM for CYP2C9.
At the recommended phase II dose of R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> , the ratio of C(max)/K(i) is >1.
R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> competitively inhibited S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> hydroxylation.
This suggests that coadministration of R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> and <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> results in a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction due to CYP2C9 inhibition by R(+) <START:DRUG> xK469 <END> .
In vitro metabolism and inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> in human liver microsomes.
We investigated the metabolism of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> , a selective leukotriene agonist, and the potential for drug-drug interactions.
The [I](in,max,u)/K(i) ratios were 0.004 and 0.003, respectively.
The K(i) values were about 300-fold greater than the [I](in,max,u), therefore it is suggested that, at clinical doses, <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> will not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and/or 2C9 or CYP3A4.
Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 appeared to be the major cytochrome P450 isoform involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> , the results suggested that <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> metabolism was inhibited less than 50% by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a reversible CYP3A4 inhibitor, or by anti-CYP3A4 antibodies.
Irreversible macrolide CYP3A4 inhibitors, <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> roxithromycin <END> , exhibited little effect on <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END>  metabolism.
On the other hand, <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> reversibly inhibited CYP2C8 and/or 2C9, and CYP3A4, with K(i) values of 3.9 and 4.1 micromol/l, respectively.
Evaluation of the inhibitory and induction potential of <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> , a novel If channel inhibitor, for human P450-mediated metabolism.
This study was designed to examine the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> , a novel cardiovascular agent, and to evaluate its potential to cause drug interactions and induction of CYP isozymes.
After incubation with pooled human liver microsomes, <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> was converted to two major metabolites (AS2036313-00, and YM-394111 or YM-394112).
The formation of AS2036313-00, and YM-394111 or YM-394112 were mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively, which was elucidated by using a bank of human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP enzymes in combination with the utilization of typical substrates and inhibitors.
The tested concentration was much higher than that in human plasma, which suggests that the induction potential of <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> is also negligible.
The Ki values of <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> for <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> , and metoprololmetabolism ranged from 59 to 340 microM, being much higher than the <START:DRUG> yM758 <END> concentration in human plasma.
The formation of AS2036313-00, and YM-394111 or YM-394112 was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> with Ki values of 140 and 0.24 microM, respectively, which indicates that YM758metabolismmay be affected by coadministration of strong CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors in vivo, given the clinical plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
After human hepatocytes were exposed to 10 microMYM758, microsomal activity and mRNA level for CYP1A2 were notinduced while those for CYP3A4 were slightlyinduced.
CYP2C8- and CYP3A-mediated C-demethylation of (3-{ [(4-tert-butylbenzyl)-(pyridine-3-sulfonyl)-amino]-methyl}-phenoxy)- <START:DRUG> acetic <END> acid (CP-533,536), an EP2 receptor-selective prostaglandin E2 agonist: characterization of metabolites by high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-nuclear magnetic resonance.
CP-533,536, (3-{ [(4-tert-butyl-benzyl)-(pyridine-3-sulfonyl)-amino]-methyl}-phenoxy)- <START:DRUG> acetic <END> acid (1), an EP2 receptor-selective prostaglandin E2 agonist, is being developed to aid in the healing of bone fractures.
To support the development of this program, in vitro metabolism of 1 was investigated in human liver microsomes and major recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms.
1 was metabolized in vitro by at least three recombinant human P450s: CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C8.
The major metabolic pathways were caused by oxidation of the tert-butyl moiety to form the omega-hydroxy metabolite (M4), oxidation of the pyridine moiety, and/or N-dealkylation of the methylphenoxy <START:DRUG> acetic <END> acid moiety.
The alcohol metabolite M4 was further oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid M3.
In addition to these pathways, three unusual metabolites (M22, M23, and M26) resulting from C-demethylation of the tert-butyl group were identified using high-resolution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/NMR.
The C-demethylated metabolites were not detected on incubation of carboxylic acid metabolite M3 with either human liver microsomes or CYP3A/2C8 isoforms, suggesting that these metabolites were not derived from decarboxylation of M3.
A possible mechanism for C-demethylation may involve the oxidation of M4 to form an aldehyde metabolite (M24), followed by P450-mediated deformylation, to give an unstable carbon-centered radical and formic acid.
The carbon-centered radical intermediate then undergoes either oxygen rebound to form an alcohol metabolite M23 or hydrogen abstraction leading to an olefin metabolite M26.
The turnover of 1 was NADPH-dependent and was completely inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> in the CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8 incubations, respectively.
Application and interpretation of hPXR screening data: Validation of reporter signal requirements for prediction of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inducers.
A human pregnane X receptor (PXR) reporter-gene assay was established and validated using 19 therapeutic agents known to be clinical CYP3A4 inducers, 5 clinical non-inducers, and 6 known inducers in human hepatocytes.
The extent of CYP3A4induction (measured as RIF ratio in comparison to <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> ) and EC50 was obtained from the dose-response curve.
All of the clinical inducers (19/19) and human hepatocyte inducers (6/6) showed positive responses in the PXR assay.
An additional series of 18 commonly used drugs with no reports of clinical induction was also evaluated as putative negative controls.
The induction potential index calculated based on the maximum RIF ratio, EC50, and in vivo maximum plasma concentration was used to predict the likelihood of CYP3A4induction in humans.
When the induction potential index is greater than 0.08, the compound is likely to cause induction in humans.
A high-throughput screening strategy was developed based on the validation results at 1 microM and 10 microM for the same set of drugs.
A RIF ratio of 0.4 was set as more practical screening cut-off to minimize the possibility of generating false positives.
Thus, a tiered approach was implemented to use the human PXR reporter-gene assay from early lead optimization to late lead characterization in drug discovery.
One out of five clinical non-inducers, <START:DRUG> pioglitazone <END> , also showed a positive response.
Sixteen of these were negative (89%), whereas two of these, <START:DRUG> flutamide <END> and <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> showed 16-fold (RIF ratio 0.79) and 10-fold (RIF ratio 0.48) maximal induction, respectively in the reporter-gene system.
 <START:DRUG> flutamide <END> and <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> were further demonstrated to cause CYP3A4induction in human cryopreserved hepatocytes based on <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activity.
Effect of <START:DRUG> butylated <END> <START:DRUG> hydroxytoluene <END> , <START:DRUG> curcumin <END> , <START:DRUG> propyl <END> <START:DRUG> gallate <END> and <START:DRUG> thiabendazole <END> on cytochrome P450 forms in cultured human hepatocytes.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of four food chemicals, namely <START:DRUG> butylated <END> <START:DRUG> hydroxytoluene <END> (BHT), <START:DRUG> curcumin <END> (CC), <START:DRUG> propyl <END> <START:DRUG> gallate <END> (PG) and <START:DRUG> thiabendazole <END> (TB), on cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms in cultured human hepatocytes.

Treatment of human hepatocytes for 72 h with 2-200 microMTB produced concentration-dependent increases in CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels, whereas treatment with BHTincreased CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels.
CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels were induced around 48-, 21- and 9-fold, respectively, by 200 microMTB, with CYP2B6 and CYP 3A4 mRNA levels being induced around /12- and 7-fold, respectively, by 200 microMBHT.
In contrast, the treatment of human hepatocytes for 72 h with PG and CC had little or no effect on CYP mRNA levels.
The treatment of human hepatocytes with TB also induced CYP1A-dependent 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase activity, whereas BHTinducedCYP3A-dependent <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity.
In summary, the results demonstrate that TB is a mixed inducer of CYP forms in human hepatocytes inducing CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP3A forms, whereas BHT is an inducer of CYP2B and CYP3A forms.
A novel bioactivation pathway for 2- [2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]ethanoic acid ( <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> ) initiated by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative decarboxylation.
 <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> (2- [2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]ethanoic acid), a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug, undergoes bioactivation by cytochrome P450 oxidation to chemically reactive metabolites that are capable of reacting with endogenous nucleophiles such as <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> (GSH) and proteins and that may play a role in the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity associated with the drug.
Here, we investigated the ability of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> to be metabolized to 2-(2,6-dichloro-phenylamino)benzyl-S-thioether <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> (DPAB-SG) in incubations with rat liver microsomes (RLMs) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) fortified with NADPH and GSH.
Thus, after incubation of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> (50 microM) with liver microsomes (1 mg protein/ml), the presence of DPAB-SG was detected in both RLM and HLM incubation extracts by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques.
The formation of DPAB-SG was NADPH-, concentration-, and time-dependent.
From these data, we propose that P450 3A4 mediates the oxidative decarboxylation of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , resulting in the formation of a transient benzylic carbon-centered free radical intermediate that partitions between elimination (o-imine methide production) and recombination (alcohol formation) pathways.
The benzyl alcohol intermediate, which was not analyzed for in the present studies, if formed could undergo dehydration to provide a reactive o-imine methide species.
The o-imine methide intermediate then is proposed to react covalently with GSH, forming DPAB-SG.
Coincubation of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> (10 microM) with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (1 microM), an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4, with HLMs led to a 75% decrease in DPAB-SG formation.
However, in contrast, coincubation with the P450 2C9 inhibitor <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (10 microM) or the P450 2D6 inhibitorquinidine (40 microM) led to a 1.9- and 1.6-fold increase in DPAB-SG production, respectively.
Stereoselective oxidation and glucuronidation of <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in human liver and intestinal microsomes.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism for the stereoselective presystemic clearance of <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> .
We examined the oxidation and glucuronidation of <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in human liver microsomes (HLM) and human intestinal microsomes (HIM).
The oxidation of <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in HLM and HIM was evaluated in the presence of NADPH, whereas glucuronidation was evaluated in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid.
Oxidation of S- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in HLM and HIM was greater than that of R- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> .
Glucuronidation of S- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in HLM and HIM was also higher than that of R- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> .
In addition, the oxidation of R- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in HLM was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , whereas that of S- <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> was inhibited by both <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> .
On the other hand, R- and S-carvediloloxidation in HIM was inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
These results suggested that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the stereoselective oxidation of <START:DRUG> carvedilol <END> in the liver, that CYP3A4 is involved in intestinal oxidation, and that glucuronidation in the liver and intestine is at least partly responsible for stereoselective presystemic clearance.
CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> clomiphene <END> .
 <START:DRUG> clomiphene <END> is a first line treatment for anovulation, a common cause of infertility.
Response to <START:DRUG> clomiphene <END> is variable and unpredictable.
 <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> is structurally related to <START:DRUG> clomiphene <END> , and also shows considerable variation in response.
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are major contributors to the metabolism of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> .
The aim of the present work was to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> , regarded by some as the more active isomer of <START:DRUG> clomiphene <END> .
 <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6.
Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> (the disappearance of drug ranged from (40-60%).
No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver.
The extent of <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p<0.001, Pearson correlation test).
The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> .
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p<0.001, one way ANOVA).
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (2 microM) had nosignificant effect on <START:DRUG> enclomiphene <END> metabolismin 3 out of the 4 EM livers.
Identification of CYP3A4 as the primary cytochrome P450 responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> by human liver microsomes.
The present study was carried out to characterize the human P450 isoforms involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> , an anxiolytic agent known for its superior efficacy and safety.
Among 11 yeast-expressed recombinant P450 isoforms tested, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 exhibited the highest <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> metabolic activity.
Although there was no qualitative difference between the two isoforms, a quantitative difference in metabolite profiling was found i.e., M4 (hydroxylation of the pyrimidine ring) was the major metabolite formed with CYP2D6 while M2 (hydroxylation of the norbornan ring) and 1-PP (oxidative cleavage of the butyl chain) predominated with CYP3A4.
The metabolite profile on incubation with CYP3A4 was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that obtained with human liver microsomes.
In vitro intrinsic clearance (CLint) values derived from kinetic analysis using both P450 isoforms were similar (2.2 and 1.6 ml/min/nmol P450), but the hepatic content of CYP3A4 was found to be more abundant than that of CYP2D6.
These results indicate that the metabolism of <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> by human liver microsomes primarily involves CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP2D6.
The in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> by human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) but not by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (a CYP2D6 inhibitor).
Phthalate induction of CYP3A4 is dependent on glucocorticoid regulation of PXR expression.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is responsible for oxidative metabolism of more than 60% of all pharmaceuticals.
CYP3A4 is inducible by xenobiotics that activate pregnane X receptor (PXR), and enhanced CYP3A4 activity has been implicated in adverse drug interactions.
Recent evidence suggest that the widely used plasticizer, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and its primary metabolite mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) may act as agonists for PXR.
Hospital patients are uniquely exposed to high levels of DEHP as well as being administered glucocorticoids.
Glucocorticoids positively regulate PXR expression in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated mechanism.
Dex induced PXR protein expression in human hepatocytes and a liver-derived rat cell line.
Understanding the role of glucocorticoid regulation of PXR as a key determinant in the magnitude of CYP3A4 induction by xenobiotics may provide insight into adverse drug effects in a sensitive population.
We suggest that the magnitude of CYP3A4 induction by phthalates is dependent on the expression of PXR and may be significantly higher in the presence of glucocorticoids.
DEHP and MEHP induced PXR-mediated transcription of the CYP3A4 promoter in a dose-dependent fashion.
Coexposure to phthalates and <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> (Dex) resulted in enhanced CYP3A4 promoter activity; furthermore, this induction was abrogated by both the GR antagonist <START:DRUG> rU486 <END> and GR small interfering ribonucleic acid.
CYP3A4 protein was highly induced by Dex and DEHP coadministration in human hepatocyte cultures.
Finally, enhanced 6beta-hydroxytestosterone formation in Dex and phthalate cotreated human hepatocytes confirmed CYP3A4 enzyme induction.
Concomitant exposure to glucocorticoids and phthalates resulting in enhanced metabolic activity of CYP3A4may play a role in altered efficacy of pharmaceutical agents.
Metabolic interactions of agrochemicals in humans.
Agrochemicals and other xenobiotics are metabolized by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) to products that may be more or less toxic than the parent chemical.
In this regard, phase-I XMEs such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are of primary importance.
Interactions at the level of metabolism may take place via either inhibition or induction of XMEs.
Such interactions have often been investigated, in vitro, in experimental animals, using subcellular fractions such as liver microsomes, but seldom in humans or at the level of individual XME isoforms.
The authors have been investigating the metabolism of a number of agrochemicals by human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP isoforms and have recently embarked on studies of the induction of XMEs in human hepatocytes.
The insecticides <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , <START:DRUG> carbaryl <END> , <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> and <START:DRUG> fipronil <END> , as well as the repellant DEET, are all extensively metabolized by human liver microsomes and, although a number of CYP isoforms may be involved, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are usually the most important.
 <START:DRUG> permethrin <END> is hydrolyzed by esterase(s) present in both human liver microsomes and cytosol.
A number of metabolic interactions have been observed.
 <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> and other phosphorothioates are potent inhibitors of the CYP-dependent metabolism of both endogenous substrates, such as <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> , and exogenous substrates, such as <START:DRUG> carbaryl <END> , presumably as a result of the interaction of highly reactive sulfur, released during the oxidative desulfuration reaction, with the <START:DRUG> heme <END> iron of CYP.
The hydrolysis of <START:DRUG> permethrin <END> in human liver can be inhibited by <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> oxon and by <START:DRUG> carbaryl <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fipronil <END> can inhibit <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> metabolism by CYP3A4 and is an effective inducer of CYP isoforms in human hepatocytes.
Flavonoids <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> and <START:DRUG> luteolin <END> inhibitmidazolammetabolism by human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP 3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes.
We evaluated the effects of increasing concentrations of the flavonoids <START:DRUG> salvigenin <END> , <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> and <START:DRUG> luteolin <END> on the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (MDZ), a probe substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes, which is converted into 1'-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (1'-OH-MDZ) and 4-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> ( <START:DRUG> 4-OH- <END> MDZ) by human liver microsomes.
To assess whether any relationship exists between the physico-chemical characteristics of flavones and their effects on MDZ metabolism, we tested the effects of three other flavones ( <START:DRUG> flavone <END> , <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> , <START:DRUG> chrysin <END> ) on MDZ metabolism by human liver microsomes.
We also found close relationships between the maximum stimulatory or inhibitory effects of flavones on 1'-OH-MDZ and <START:DRUG> 4-OH- <END> MDZ formation rates and their log of octanol/water partition coefficients (logP) or their total number of hydroxyl groups.
 <START:DRUG> salvigenin <END> had only a modest effect on MDZmetabolism, whereas <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> and <START:DRUG> luteolin <END> inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the formation of both 1'-OH-MDZ and <START:DRUG> 4-OH- <END> MDZ, with apparent K(i) values in the 30-50mumol range.
Both <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> and luteolindecreased 1'-OH-MDZ formation by human recombinant CYP3A4, but notCYP3A5, whereas they decreased <START:DRUG> 4-OH- <END> MDZ formation by both recombinant enzymes.
Whereas flavones possessing more than two hydroxyl groups ( <START:DRUG> luteolin <END> , <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> ) inhibited MDZ biotransformation, flavones lacking hydroxyl groups in their A and B rings ( <START:DRUG> flavone <END> , <START:DRUG> tangeretin <END> ) stimulatedMDZmetabolism.
The results of the study may be of clinical relevance since they suggest that <START:DRUG> luteolin <END> and <START:DRUG> diosmetin <END> may cause pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered drugs metabolized via CYP3A.
Effect of <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> on cytochrome P450 forms in cultured rat and human hepatocytes.
High doses of <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> produce liver and thyroid gland tumours in rats by modes of action involving the induction of hepatic xenobiotic metabolising enzymes.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> with those of the rat liver and thyroid tumour promoter sodium <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> on some cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms in cultured rat and human hepatocytes.
The treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rat and human (both male and female) hepatocytes for 72 h with 0-1000 microMPyrethrins and 0-1000 microMPhenobarbital did not result in any marked cytotoxicity.
The effects of <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> were concentration-dependent and exhibited a threshold.
These results demonstrate that the effects of <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> on CYP forms in cultured rat and human hepatocytes are qualitatively similar to those of <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> .
While CYP form induction by <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> and related compounds can be associated with liver and thyroid gland tumour formation in rodents, epidemiological data for <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> suggests that such effects do not occur in humans.
In rat hepatocytes both <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> produced an induction of 7-benzyloxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> O-debenzylase activity (a CYP1A/2B form marker) and CYP2B1 and CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels.
 <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> also inducedCYP3A-dependent <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity in rat hepatocytes.
In human hepatocytes <START:DRUG> pyrethrins <END> and Phenobarbitalinduced both <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity and CYP3A4 mRNA levels and also increased CYP2B6 mRNA levels.
PyrethrinsinduceCYP2B and CYP3A forms in cultured rat hepatocytes and can induceCYP3A and CYP2B forms in human hepatocytes.
 <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> -mediated up-regulation of human CYP2A6 involves the glucocorticoid receptor and increased binding of hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha to the proximal promoter.
Human cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) metabolizes various clinically relevant compounds, including <START:DRUG> nicotine <END> - and tobacco-specific procarcinogens; however, transcriptional regulation of this gene is poorly understood.
We investigated the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in transcriptional regulation of CYP2A6.
Mutation of the HNF4-RE abrogated HNF4alpha- and DEX-mediated transactivation of CYP2A6.
Electrophoretic mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and streptavidin DNA binding assays revealed that DEXincreased binding of HNF4alpha to the HNF4-RE and that an interaction of GR and HNF4alpha occurred at this site.
Moreover, ChIP assays indicated that histone H4 acetylation of the CYP2A6 proximal promoter chromatin was increased by DEX that may allow for increased binding of HNF4alpha to the HNF4-RE in human hepatocytes.
These findings indicate that increased expression of CYP2A6 by DEX is mediated by the GR via a nonconventional transcriptional mechanism involving interaction of HNF4alpha with an HNF4-RE rather than a glucocorticoid response element.
 <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> (DEX)increased CYP2A6 mRNA and protein levels in human hepatocytes in primary culture.
This effect was attenuated by the GR receptor antagonist <START:DRUG> mifepristone <END> ( <START:DRUG> rU486 <END> ; 17beta-hydroxy-11beta- [4-dimethylamino phenyl]-17alpha- [1-propynyl]estra-4,9-dien-3-one), suggesting that induction of CYP2A6 by DEX was mediated by the GR.
In gene reporter assays, DEX caused dose-dependent increases in luciferase activity that was also prevented by <START:DRUG> rU486 <END> and progressive truncations of the CYP2A6 promoter delineated DEX-responsiveness to a -95 to +12 region containing an hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) alpha response element (HNF4-RE).
In addition, overexpression of HNF4alpha increased CYP2A6 transcriptional activity by 3-fold.
DEXincreased HNF4alpha mRNA levels by 4-fold; however, the amount of HNF4alpha nuclear protein was unaltered.
The inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid on cytochrome P450 enzymes and NADPH-CYP reductase in rat and human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid has been shown to decrease mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity of several amine derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in rodents.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid on cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed oxidations using rat liver microsomes (RLM) and human liver microsomes (HLM) as the enzyme sources.
These results suggested that the inhibition of CYP enzyme activities by <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acidmay be partially attributed to its inhibition of NADPH-CYP reductase activity.
In RLM, <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid showed a non-selective inhibitory effect on 7-methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD), 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation (EROD), <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activities with IC(50)values ranged from 14.9 to 27.4 microM.
In HLM, <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acidinhibitedEROD, MROD and <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation activities with IC(50) values ranged from 5.1 to 7.5 microM, and <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation, <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation with IC(50) values ranged from 20 to 77 microM.
In baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYP 1A1 and 1A2, the IC(50) values of <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid for CYP 1A1- and 1A2-catalyzedEROD activities were 23.1 and 2.3 microM, respectively, indicating that <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid preferably inhibited the activity of CYP1A2.
 <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid inhibited human CYP1A2 non-competitively with a Ki value of 4.8 microM.
 <START:DRUG> tannic <END> acid was also found to inhibit NADPH-CYP reductase in RLM and HLM with IC(50) values of 11.8 and 17.4 microM, respectively.
Inhibitory effects of angiotensin receptor blockers on CYP2C9 activity in human liver microsomes.
We investigated the inhibitory effects of the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), <START:DRUG> candesartan <END> , <START:DRUG> irbesartan <END> , <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , <START:DRUG> losartan <END> active metabolite (EXP-3174), <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> , <START:DRUG> telmisartan <END> and <START:DRUG> valsartan <END> (0.3-300 microM), on the CYP2C9 activity in human liver microsomes using (S)-(-)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> as a typical CYP2C9 substrate.
A three-dimensional model for docking between EXP-3174 and CYP2C9 indicated that the chloro group of EXP-3174 is oriented to a hydrophobic pocket in the CYP2C9 active site, indicating that the lipophilicity of the group present in ARBs at the position corresponding to that of the hydroxyisopropyl group in <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> is important in inhibitingCYP2C9 activity.
Except for <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> and <START:DRUG> valsartan <END> , these ARBs inhibited the activity of 7-hydroxylation of (S)-(-)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> with IC50 values of 39.5-116 microM.
Of six synthetic derivatives of <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> , five compounds which possess either alkyl groups or a chloro group at the same position as that of the hydroxyisopropyl group in <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> inhibited CYP2C9 activity with IC50 values of 21.7-161 microM.
 <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> and the <START:DRUG> olmesartan <END> analogue, RNH-6272, both having a hydroxyisopropyl group, showed no inhibition, indicating that the hydrophilicity of this group greatly contributes to the lack of CYP2C9 inhibition by these two compounds.
Identification of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in biotransformation of <START:DRUG> vicriviroc <END> , a CCR5 receptor antagonist.
 <START:DRUG> vicriviroc <END> (SCH 417690), a CCR5 receptor antagonist, is currently under investigation for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
The objective of this study was to identify human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> vicriviroc <END> .
Human liver microsomes metabolized <START:DRUG> vicriviroc <END> via N-oxidation (M2/M3), O-demethylation (M15), N,N-dealkylation (M16), N-dealkylation (M41), and oxidation to a carboxylic acid metabolite (M35b/M37a).
The results of this study suggest that formation of the major <START:DRUG> vicriviroc <END> metabolites in human liver microsomes is primarily mediated via CYP3A4.
These enzymology data will provide guidance to design clinical studies to address any potential drug-drug interactions.
Recombinant human CYP3A4  the formation of all these metabolites, whereas CYP3A5 catalyzed the formation of M2/M3 and M41.
CYP2C9 only catalyzed the formation of M15.
There was a high correlation between the rates of formation of M2/M3, M15, and M41, which was determined using 10 human liver microsomal samples and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 (r > or = 0.91).
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> azamulin <END> (inhibitors of CYP3A4) were potent inhibitors of the formation of M2/M3, M15, M41, and M35b/M37a from human liver microsomes.
A CYP3A4/5-specific monoclonal antibody (1 microg/microg of protein) inhibited the formation of all metabolites from human liver microsomes by 86 to 100%.
CYP2C9 and CYP3A5 most likely play a minor role in the biotransformation of this compound.
Kinetics of the time-dependent inactivation of CYP2D6 in cryopreserved human hepatocytes by <START:DRUG> methylenedioxymethamphetamine <END> (MDMA).
 <START:DRUG> methylenedioxymethamphetamine <END> (MDMA) was investigated in cryopreserved human hepatocytes as a time-dependent inactivator (TDI) of CYP2D6 using <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> (DEX) as a probe substrate.
Inhibition kinetic parameters k(inact), the maximal rate of inactivation, and K(I), the inhibitor concentration at half the maximal activation rate, were determined.
Time- and concentration-dependent inhibition were confirmed, and the influence of different elements of study design (e.g. cell number, stability of hepatocytes, dilution after preincubation) on estimated kinetic parameters were evaluated.
Dilution factors (DF) of 1.2, 5 or total removal of inhibitor (by washing cells after preincubation, WR) resulted in k(inact) and K(I) (+/-S.E.) values of 0.02+/-0.002 min(-1) and 0.88+/-0.31 microM, 0.01+/-0.001 min(-1) and 1.23+/-0.70 microM, and 0.01+/-0.001 min(-1) and 2.10+/-1.32 microM, respectively; indicating that insufficient dilution may lead to overestimation of CYP2D6inactivation.
Inactivation efficiency in hepatocytes, as measured by k(inact)/K(I) , was 10-fold less than that previously reported in human liver microsomes or recombinantly expressed systems.
Possible causes for the observed differences between in vitro systems warrant further investigation.
These may include differences in metabolic consumption of MDMA in each system, non-specific binding and presence of active efflux in hepatocytes.
Accounting for MDMA depletion during the preincubation, corrected K(I) values were significantly lower (0.11+/-0.05 microM , 0.15+/-0.09 microM , 0.24+/-0.16 microM for DF of 1.2, 5, and WR, respectively).
Inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 by a pyrimidineimidazole: Evidence for complex <START:DRUG> heme <END> interactions.
 <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> inhibits the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by coordinating with the <START:DRUG> heme <END> of the monomeric form and preventing formation of the active dimer.
Inherent with the mechanism of pharmacology for this compound was the inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (P450 3A4), observed from early ADME screening.
As expected, spectral binding analysis demonstrated that inhibition was a result of type II coordination to the P450 <START:DRUG> heme <END> with the <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> moiety of <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> , although only 72% of the maximal absorbance difference was achievable with <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> compared to that of the smaller ligand <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> .
Time-dependent inhibition of P450 3A4 by <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> was also observed because of metabolite-inhibitory (MI) complex formation via metabolism of the methylenedioxyphenyl group.
Spectral characterization of the <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> MI complex demonstrated that formation began to plateau within 3 min, consistent with the kinetic profile of inactivation by <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> .
Meanwhile, spectral evidence for the <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> -derived type II difference spectrum of <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> was captured simultaneously with the formation of the MI complex.
The presence of simultaneously operable type II coordination and rapidly saturable MI complex formation with <START:DRUG> heme <END> by <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> indicates the presence of complex <START:DRUG> heme <END> interactions with this unique molecule.
Information from these mechanistic studies adds to our understanding of the nature of P450 3A4 inhibition by <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> and provides a potentially useful tool compound for future studies investigating binding interactions in this important drug-metabolizing enzyme.
Further investigation showed that <START:DRUG> pH-302 <END> inhibited P450 3A4 competitively with a Ki of approximately 2.0 microM against both <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> hydroxylation in human liver microsomes.
The profile for time-dependent inhibition in recombinant P450 3A4 was biphasic, and was kinetically characterized by a kinact of 0.08 min-1 and a Ki of 1.2 microM for the first phase (0-1.5 min) and a kinact of 0.06 min-1 and a Ki of 23.8 microM for the second phase (1.5-10 min).
Effects of serotonin-3 receptor antagonists on cytochrome P450 activities in human liver microsomes.
The effects of three serotonin-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists, <START:DRUG> azasetron <END> , <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> , and <START:DRUG> ramosetron <END> , on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2-mediated 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation, CYP2C9-mediated <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation, CYP2C19-mediated S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation, CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> 4-hydroxylation, CYP2E1-mediated <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation, CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation, and CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activities in human liver microsomes were compared.
The free fractions of the three 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists in the incubation mixture estimated by ultracentrifugation were more than 68.6%.
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> azasetron <END> , <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> , and <START:DRUG> ramosetron <END> do not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYPs via the inhibition of metabolism .
 <START:DRUG> azasetron <END> and <START:DRUG> ramosetron <END> at a concentration of 1 or 10 muM neither inhibited nor stimulated any of the metabolic activities.
On the other hand, <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> competitively inhibited CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activities, and the inhibition constants (K(i) ) were 3.2 and 21.0 muM , respectively, which are much higher than the reported plasma concentrations after clinical intravenous or oral dosing.
Inhibitory effects of cytostatically active 6-aminobenzo [c]phenanthridines on cytochrome P450 enzymes in human hepatic microsomes.
Besides assays for the evaluation of efficacy new drug candidates have to undergo extensive testings for enhancement of pharmaceutical drug safety and optimization of application.
The objective of the present work was to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction potential for the cytostatically active 6-aminobenzo [c]phenanthridines <START:DRUG> bP-11 <END> (6-amino-11,12-dihydro-11-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)benzo [c]phenanthridine) and <START:DRUG> bP-D7 <END> (6-amino-11-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)benzo [c]phenanthridine) in vitro through incubation with human hepatic microsomes and marker substrates.
For these studies the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and corresponding marker substrates recommended by the EMEA (The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) were chosen.
In detail these selective substrates were <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> (CYP2A6), <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (CYP2C9), S-(+)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19), dextromethorphane (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CYP2E1) and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (CYP3A4).
Incubations with each substrate were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of a benzo [c]phenanthridine or a selective inhibitor at varying concentrations.
Marker activities were determined by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography).
For the isoenzymes showing more than 50% inhibition by the addition of 20 microM <START:DRUG> bP-11 <END> or <START:DRUG> bP-D7 <END> additional concentrations of substrate and inhibitor were tested for a characterization of the inhibition.
The studies showed a moderate risk for <START:DRUG> bP-11 <END> for interactions with the cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> bP-D7 <END> , the compound with the highest cytotstatic efficacy, showed only a moderate risk for interactions with drugs, also metabolized by CYP3A4.
In vitro studies on <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> metabolism using the substrate depletion approach with focus on drug-drug interactions.
The metabolism of the atypical antipsychotic <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> was investigated by in vitro methods.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 measuring substrate depletion and product formation.
The isozyme CYP2D6 played a minor role in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> as CYP3A4 contributed 89% to the overall metabolism .
A Km value of 18 microM was determined by substrate depletion, suggesting linear kinetics under therapeutic conditions.
The cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 displayed activity towards <START:DRUG> quetiapine <END> .
Drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4, such as <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> , displayed almost complete inhibition at low concentrations, whereas inhibitors of CYP2D6 do not seem to have a clinically relevant effect.
The CYP2C8 inhibitor <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> does not increase the plasma concentrations of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
 <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> is a short acting hypnotic, which is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C8 in vitro.
We studied the possible effect of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , an inhibitor of CYP2C8, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
In a randomised 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mggemfibrozil or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, each ingested a 7.5 mg dose of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> and its two primary metabolites, plasma <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , and psychomotor performance were measured.
The effects of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors on the depletion of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (500 nM) were studied in vitro in human liver microsomes.
Accordingly, CYP2C8 does not significantly metabolise <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> in vivo.
However, as <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raises the concentrations of two potentially active metabolites of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> , slightly enhanced effects of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> can not be excluded.
The pharmacokinetic variables of the parent <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> were not significantly affected by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> raised the mean peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (1.6-fold; P<0.001) and that of <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> - <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> (1.2-fold; P<0.001).
The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0)-infinity) values of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> and <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> - <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> were raised 2-fold (P<0.001) and 1.2-fold (P<0.01), respectively.
The renal clearance of N-oxide- <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> was reduced by 48%/cons by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (P<0.001).
The pharmacodynamic effects of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> , measured using psychometric tests, were not affected by <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> .
In vitro, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (1 microM) and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (8 microM) decreased the elimination rate of <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> enantiomers by about 65-95% while <START:DRUG> montelukast <END> (16 microM), <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> (200 microM) and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (10 microM) had no appreciable effect.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> does not increase the plasma concentrations of the parent <START:DRUG> zopiclone <END> .
Evaluation of time-dependent cytochrome P450 inhibition using cultured human hepatocytes.
Primary human hepatocytes in culture are commonly used to evaluate cytochrome P450 (P450) induction via an enzyme activity endpoint.
However, other processes can confound data interpretation.
To this end, the impact of time-dependent P450 inhibition in this system was evaluated.
Using a substrate-cassette approach, P450 activities were determined after incubation with the prototypic inhibitors <START:DRUG> tienilic acid <END> (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (CYP3A4).
Kinetic analysis of enzyme inactivation in hepatocytes was used to describe the effect of these time-dependent inhibitors and derive the inhibition parameters kinact and KI ) which generally were in good agreement with the values derived using recombinant P450s and human liver microsomes (HLMs).
This work demonstrates that caution is warranted in the interpretation of enzyme induction studies with metabolically stable, weak time-dependent inhibitors , which may have dramatic inhibitory effects on P450 activity in this system.
Therefore, in addition to enzyme activity, mRNA and/or protein levels should be measured to fully evaluate the P450 induction potential of a drug candidate.
 <START:DRUG> tienilic acid <END> selectively inhibited CYP2C9-dependent <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation activity, and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> inhibited CYP3A4-dependent <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
 <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> also inhibited CYP2C19-dependent S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in hepatocytes, HLMs, and recombinant CYP2C19 (KI0.4 microM and kinact 0.5 min(-1)).
As expected, the effect of <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> on CYP2D6 in hepatocytes was consistent with potent yet reversible inhibition.
A very weak time-dependent CYP2C9 inhibitor ( <START:DRUG> aZ1 <END> , a proprietary AstraZeneca compound; KI 30 microM and kinact 0.02 min(-1)) effectively abolished CYP2C9 activity over 24 h at low (micromolar) concentrations in primary cultured human hepatocytes.
Identification of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> ( <START:DRUG> sarasar <END> ).
 <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> ( <START:DRUG> sarasar <END> ) , a <START:DRUG> farnesyl <END> transferase inhibitor , is currently under development for the treatment of solid tumors.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> with human liver microsomes resulted in the formation of four oxidative metabolites (M1, M2, M3, and M4).
minor to trace levels of these metabolites were detected in humans after multiple-dose administration of <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> .
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses exhibited a mass to charge ratio (m/z) for the (M+H)(+) ion of M1, M2, M3, and M4 at 653, 635, 669, and 653 Th, respectively.
These metabolites, respectively, resulted from changes of +O, -2H, +2O, and +O relative to <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> .
In conclusion, the formation of metabolites M1, M2, and M3 from <START:DRUG> lonafarnib <END> was mediated via CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
Recombinant human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 exhibited catalytic activity with respect to the formation of M1, M2, and M3, whereas CYP2C8 exhibited catalytic activity with respect to the formation of M4.
There was a high correlation between the formation of M1, determined in 10 human liver microsomal samples, and 6beta-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END>  by CYP3A4/5 (r = 0.93).
The IC(50) values of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> for inhibition of M1 and M2 were 0.61 and 0.92 microM, respectively.
The formation of M4 by human liver microsomes was inhibited72% by 50 microMquercetin, suggesting that the formation of M4 was mediated via CYP2C8.
A CYP3A4/5-specific inhibitory monoclonal antibody inhibited the formation of M1, M2, and M3 by 85, 75, and 100%, respectively.
In vitro inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> 1-aminobenzotriazole <END> on drug oxidations in human liver microsomes: a comparison with <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> .
 <START:DRUG> 1-aminobenzotriazole <END> (ABT) is extensively used as a non-specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor.
In this study, the inhibitory effect of ABT on CYP-dependent drug oxidations was investigated in human liver microsomes (HLM) and compared with that of <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> , another non-specific inhibitor.
The following probe activities for human CYP isoforms were determined using pooled HLM: <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2); <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9); S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation, (CYP2C19); <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation (CYP2D6); <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1); <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation, and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A).
The inhibitory effects of ABT and <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> were increased by preincubation in some probe reactions, and this preincubation effect was greater in ABT than in <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> .
In conclusion, ABT and <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> had a wide range of IC50 values in inhibiting the drug oxidations by HLM with and without preincubation.
ABT had the strongest inhibitory effect on the CYP3A-dependent drug oxidations and the weakest effect on the <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation.
 <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> potently inhibited the <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation, but weakly inhibited <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation.
The remarkable IC50 shift (> 10 times) by preincubation with ABT was observed on the <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation, <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation, and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation.
Effect of the <START:DRUG> st.
John's wort <END> constituent <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> on <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism by human hepatocyte cultures.
 <START:DRUG> st.
John's wort <END> is a commonly used herbal medication that increases cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity.
Because <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> is inactivated by CYP3A, we studied the effects of the <START:DRUG> st.
John's wort <END> constituent <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> on <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism in a human hepatocyte model.
Hepatocytes, isolated from three donor livers, were exposed to <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> (0.1, 0.5, or 1.5 micromol/L) or <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (10 micromol/L) for 48 hours.
After 48 hours, <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> - or <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> -containing medium was replaced with medium containing 100 micromol/L <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
After 1 hour, <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism was characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Subsequent incubations characterized the specific cytochrome P450s that produced the <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolites observed in hepatocyte incubations.
 <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolites identified in <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> - and <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> -treated hepatocyte preparations included the previously described tert-butyl-hydroxylated metabolite and two previously unidentified metabolites involving hydroxylation on the baccatin ring.
CYP3A4 produced the tert-butyl-hydroxylated metabolite and the two ring-hydroxylated metabolites.
CYP2C8 produced one of the newly described ring-hydroxylated metabolites.
This implies that subtherapeutic <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> concentrations may result when <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> is administered to patients using <START:DRUG> st.
John's wort <END> on a chronic basis.
The results also show induction of previously undescribed metabolic pathways for <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> , one of which may be analogous to the known 6-alpha-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> by CYP2C8.
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> induced <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism 6.8- to 32-fold above <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism in control cultures.
 <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> induced <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism in all three hepatocyte preparations.
 <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> induction was dose-dependent and, at maximum, was 2.6- to 7-foldgreater than that in controls.
Exposure to the <START:DRUG> st.
John's wort <END> constituent <START:DRUG> hyperforin <END> induces <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> metabolism in vitro.
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro: effect of fibrates and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> is an antidiabetic drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes.
To clarify the mechanisms of observed <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> drug interactions, we determined the contribution of the two enzymes to <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism at different substrate concentrations, and examined the effect of fibrates and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism in vitro.
We studied <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism using pooled human liver microsomes, recombinant CYP2C8 and recombinant CYP3A4 enzymes.
The effect of <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> on <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism , and of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , <START:DRUG> bezafibrate <END> , <START:DRUG> fenofibrate <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> on CYP2C8 ( <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylation) and CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1-hydroxylation) activities and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism were studied using human liver microsomes.
At therapeutic <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> concentrations (<0.4 microM), CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolised <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> at similar rates.
In conclusion, both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are important in the metabolism of therapeutic concentrations of <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in vitro, but their predicted contributions in vivo are highly dependent on the scaling factor used.
 <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> (25 microM) and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> (3 microM) inhibited the metabolism of 0.2 microM <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> by 58% and 71%, and that of 2 microM <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> by 56% and 59%, respectively.
The three fibrates inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki: <START:DRUG> bezafibrate <END> 9.7 microM , <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> 30.4 microM and <START:DRUG> fenofibrate <END> 92.6 microM) and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism (IC50 : <START:DRUG> bezafibrate <END> 37.7 microM, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> 111 microM and <START:DRUG> fenofibrate <END> 164 microM), but had no effect on CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki 30.2 microM ), CYP3A4 (Ki 18.5 microM ) and <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> metabolism (IC5013.7 microM ).
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> is only a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and does not inhibit CYP3A4 ; inhibition of CYP-enzymes by parent <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> alone does not explain its interaction with <START:DRUG> repaglinide <END> in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> competitively inhibits both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which can counteract its inducing effect in humans.
Effect of antifungal drugs on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes.
The effects of five antifungal drugs, <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> micafungin <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> , on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9-mediated <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation, CYP2C19-mediated S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation, and CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation activities in human liver microsomes were compared.
In addition, the effects of preincubation were estimated to investigate the mechanism-based inhibition.
The IC50 value of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> against <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation was comparable with that of <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> micafungin <END> and higher than that of <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> .
The stimulation of the inhibition of CYP2C9-, CYP2C19-, or CYP3A4-mediated reactions by 15-min preincubation was not observed for any of the antifungal drugs, suggesting that these drugs are not mechanism-based inhibitors .
The IC50 value against <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation was the lowest for <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> (2.0 microM) , followed by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (8.4 microM) and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> (30.3 microM).
Similarly, the IC50 value against S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation was the lowest for <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> (0.33 microM), followed by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> (8.7 microM) and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> (12.3 microM) .
On the other hand, <START:DRUG> micafungin <END> at a concentration of 10 or 25 microM neither inhibited nor stimulatedtolbutamide hydroxylation and S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation, and the IC50 values for <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> against these were greater than 10 microM .
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> is the strongest inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, followed by <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , whereas <START:DRUG> micafungin <END> would not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 via the inhibition of metabolism.
Contribution of human hepatic cytochrome p450 isoforms to the metabolism of psychotropic drugs.
The metabolic activities of six psychotropic drugs, <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> , <START:DRUG> clotiazepam <END> , <START:DRUG> tofisopam <END> , <START:DRUG> etizolam <END> , <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> , and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , were determined for 14 isoforms of recombinant human hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and human liver microsomes by measuring the disappearance rate of parent compounds.
In vitro kinetic studies revealed that Vmax/Km values in human liver microsomes were the highest for <START:DRUG> tofisopam <END> , followed by <START:DRUG> tandospirone <END> > <START:DRUG> clotiazepam <END> > <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> , and <START:DRUG> etizolam <END> .
Among the recombinant CYPs, CYP3A4 exhibited the highest metabolic activities of all compounds except for <START:DRUG> clotiazepam <END> and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> .
These results suggest that the psychotropic drugs investigated are metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, except that CYP2D6 catalyzes the metabolism of <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> .
In addition, this approach based on the disappearance rate appears to be useful for the identification of the responsible CYP isoform(s) of older drugs, for which metabolic profiles have not been reported.
The metabolism of <START:DRUG> clotiazepam <END> was catalyzed by CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19, and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> was metabolized by CYP2D6 most efficiently.
In addition, the metabolic activities of <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> , <START:DRUG> clotiazepam <END> , and <START:DRUG> etizolam <END> in human liver microsomes were inhibited by 2.5 microM <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a CYP3A4 inhibitor , by 97.5%, 65.1%, and 83.5%, respectively, and the <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> metabolism was not detected after the addition of 1 or 10 microM <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a CYP2D6 inhibitor .
Rate-limiting biotransformation of <START:DRUG> triamterene <END> is mediated by CYP1A2.
 <START:DRUG> triamterene <END> (TA), a potassium-sparing diuretic, is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation in 4'-position and subsequent conjugation by cytosolic sulfotransferases.
To identify the cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) catalyzing hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> triamterene <END> (the rate-limiting step in the formation of the sulfate ester (STA)), in vitro incubation studies were performed with human liver microsomes.
Initial rates of TA hydroxylation (0 - 300 microM) were determined during a ten-minute-incubation period with liver microsomes of two donors.
The role of individual CYP enzymes was determined by pre-incubation with selective inhibitors/alternative substrates .
Vice versa, the effect of TA (0 - 500 microM) on 3-demethylation of <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (0 - 1,000 microM) was assessed.
Metabolite concentrations were estimated by reversed-phase HPLC methods.
TA Km values without inhibitors were 60 and 142 microM , Vmax was 177 and 220 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively.
4'-hydroxylation of TA in humans appears to be mediated exclusively by CYP1A2.
Inhibition or induction of CYP1A2 will change the time course of both TA and its active phase-II metabolite.
The net pharmacodynamic effect of such changes is difficult to predict and needs to be evaluated in clinical studies.
Mean inhibitor induced changes of 4'-hydroxy-TA formation were as follows: Furafylline25 microM (CYP1A2), complete inhibition (-100%); omeprazole250 microM (CYP1A2 inhibitor / CYP2C 19 substrate), -30%; <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 25 microM (CYP2A6), -11%; <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> 25 microM (CYP2D6), -9%; <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> 25 microM (CYP3A), -18%; and erythromycin250 microM (CYP3A), -8%.
In the reverse inhibition studies, TA competitively inhibited <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> 3-demethylation with Ki values of 65 and 111 microM , respectively.
A potentially significant interaction between <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> : a case report and review of the literature.
Although it has not been demonstrated yet, <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> is expected to reduce <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> exposure through coinduction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2B6.
Conversely, <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> has been shown in vitro to inhibit the enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> metabolism , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
We report a case in which a potential bidirectional drug interaction between <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> and <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> resulted in lower-than-expected <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> concentrations and elevated <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> levels.
Therapeutic drug monitoring was used in this case to ensure adequate <START:DRUG> efavirenz <END> exposure.
()
 <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> 2-hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in vitro: <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> disposition is influenced by CYP2C9, but not by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism.
We evaluated the involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 2C9 and 2C19 in <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> 2-hydroxylation in vitro and in <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> disposition in vivo.
To identify CYP isoforms(s) that catalyse 2-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> , the incubation studies were conducted using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP isoforms.
To evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19 influence the disposition of <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> , a single oral dose of 250 mgchlorpropamide was administered to 21 healthy subjects pregenotyped for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
In human liver microsomal incubation studies, the formation of 2-hydroxychlorpropamide (2-OH- <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> ), a major <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> metabolite in human, has been best described by a one-enzyme model with estimated K(m) and V(max) of 121.7 +/- 19.9 microm and 16.1 +/- 5.0 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively.
In incubation studies using human recombinant CYP isoforms, however, 2-OH- <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> was formed by both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 with similar intrinsic clearances (CYP2C9 vs. CYP2C19: 0.26 vs. 0.22 microl min(-1) nmol(-1) protein).
In in vivo clinical trials, eight subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype exhibited significantly lower nonrenal clearance [*1/*3 vs.*1/*1: 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.1 ml h(-1) kg(-1), P < 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference 0.2, 1.0] and higher metabolic ratios (of <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> /2-OH- <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> in urine: *1/*3 vs.*1/*1: 1.01 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.08, P < 0.05; 95% CI on the difference - 0.9, - 0.1) than did 13 subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype.
In contrast, no differences in <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> pharmacokinetics were observed for subjects with the CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer vs. poor metabolizer genotypes.
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> disposition is principally determined by CYP2C9 activity in vivo, although both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 have a catalysing activity of <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> 2-hydroxylation pathway.
Formation of 2-OH- <START:DRUG> chlorpropamide <END> in human liver microsomes was significantly inhibited by <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> ,but not by S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , or <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> .
Different effects of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> on <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1''-hydroxylation by rat and human CYP2D enzymes.
Inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (DMI) on rat and human CYP2D enzymes were studied using <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> (BF) 1''-hydroxylation as an index.
Inhibition was examined under the following two conditions: 1) DMI was co-incubated with BF and NADPH in the reaction mixture containing rat or human liver microsomes or yeast cell microsomes expressing rat CYP2D1, CYP2D2 or human CYP2D6 (co-incubation); 2) DMI was preincubated with NADPH and the same enzyme sources prior to adding the substrate (preincubation).
When either rat liver microsomes or recombinant CYP2D2 was employed, the preincubation with DMI (0.3 microM) caused a greaterinhibition of BF 1''-hydroxylation than the co-incubation did, whereas BF 1''-hydroxylation by rat CYP2D1 was not markedly affected under the same conditions.
Kinetic studies demonstrated that the inhibition-type changed from competitive for the co-incubation to noncompetitive for the preincubation in the case of CYP2D2, whereas the inhibition-type was competitive for both the co-incubation and the preincubation in the case of CYP2D6.
Furthermore, the loss of activity of rat CYP2D2 under the preincubation conditions followed pseudo-first-order kinetics.
Binding experiments employing the recombinant enzymes and [(3)H]-DMI revealed that CYP2D2 and CYP2D6 were the only prominent proteins to which considerable radioactive DMI metabolite(s) bound.
These results indicate that rat CYP2D2 biotransforms DMI into reactive metabolite(s), which covalently bind to CYP2D2, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme.
In contrast, human CYP2D6may also biotransform DMI into some metabolite(s) that covalently bind to CYP2D6, but that do not inactivate the enzyme.
The inhibitory effect of DMI on BF 1''-hydroxylation by human liver microsomal fractions or recombinant CYP2D6 was much lower than that on the hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes or CYP2D2.
Cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> .
The in vitro metabolism of [(14)C]- <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> (1-3 microM) was investigated using human liver microsomes and a range of expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes, with particular focus on the formation of O-desmethyl- <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> ( <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> ) , the major metabolite observed in human plasma.
High-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light, radiochemical and mass spectral analysis, together with the availability of authentic standards, enabled quantification and structural identification of metabolites.
On incubation with pooled human liver microsomes, [(14)C]- <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> underwent rapid and extensive metabolism to a number of metabolites, although <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> was only a minor microsomal product.
 <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> was metabolized extensively by expressed CYP3A4, producing a similar range of metabolites to liver microsomes, but <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> was not formed.
CYP1A2, 2C9 and 2C19 produced no measurable metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> ,while CYP3A5 produced a range of metabolites similar to CYP3A4, but to a much lower degree.
While formation of <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> was CYP2D6 mediated, the overall metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> was dependent primarily on CYP3A4, and this was not obviously diminished in liver microsomes from CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.
Formation of most metabolites was markedlydecreased by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , but <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> production was inhibited only by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
In contrast, CYP2D6 catalysed rapid and extensive metabolism of <START:DRUG> gefitinib <END> to <START:DRUG> m523595 <END> .
Comparative effects of fibrates on drug metabolizing enzymes in human hepatocytes.
The induction potential of different fibric acid derivatives on human drug metabolizing enzymes was evaluated to help assess the role of enzyme induction on pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
Effects of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , <START:DRUG> fenofibric <END> acid , and <START:DRUG> clofibric acid <END> on expression levels of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) 3A4 and 2C8 and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 were evaluated in primary human hepatocyte cultures.
The potential for these fibrates to activate human pregnane X receptor (PXR) also was studied in a cell-based PXR reporter gene assay.
On average, the effects on CYP3A4 were less than (< or =30% of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ), while those on CYP2C8 and UGT1A1 were comparable to or slightly higher than (up to 200% of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ) the corresponding effects observed with <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> (10 microM).
No significantactivation on human pregnane X receptor (PXR) was observed with the three fibrates in a PXR reporter gene assay.
In this system, all fibrates are weak inducers of UGT1A1.
The enzyme inducing effects of fibrates appear to be mediated via a mechanism(s) other than PXR activation.
These results suggest that fibrates may have potential to cause various pharmacokinetic drug interactions via their differential effects on enzyme induction and/or inhibition.
All three fibrates caused increases in mRNA levels of CYP3A4 (2- to 5-fold), CYP2C8 (2- to 6-fold), and UGT1A1 (2- to 3-fold).
Consistent with the mRNA results, all fibrates caused moderate (approximately 2- to 3-fold) increases in CYP3A4 activity (measured by <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta hydroxylase), as compared to about a 10-fold increase by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
significant increases (3- to 6-fold) in <START:DRUG> amodiaquine <END> N-deethylase (a functional probe for CYP2C8 activity) also were observed with <START:DRUG> clofibric acid <END> , <START:DRUG> fenofibric <END> acid , and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , in agreement with the mRNA finding.
However, in contrast to the mRNA induction, markeddecreases (>60%) in CYP2C8 activity were obtained with <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> treatment.
Consistent with this finding, co-incubation of <START:DRUG> amodiaquine <END> with <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> but not with <START:DRUG> fenofibric <END> acid , <START:DRUG> clofibric acid <END> , or <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ,in human liver microsomes or hepatocytes resulted in significantlydecreasedamodiaquine N-deethylase activity (IC50 = 80 microM for <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , >500 microM for <START:DRUG> fenofibric <END> or <START:DRUG> clofibric acid <END> , and >50 microM for <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> ).
Similar to <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , all three fibrates caused a modest change in the glucuronidation of <START:DRUG> chrysin <END> , a nonspecific substrate of UGTs.
In human hepatocytes, both <START:DRUG> fenofibric <END> acid and <START:DRUG> clofibric acid <END> are inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> is also an inducer of CYP3A4, but acts as both an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP2C8.
Identification of human P450 isoforms involved in the metabolism of the antiallergic drug, <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> , and its kinetic parameters and inhibition constants.
 <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> is an antiallergic drug used for the treatment of diseases mediated by type I allergy.
Recently, <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> , which have antiallergic actions similar to those of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> , showed side effects on the cardiovascular system.
This might be because concomitant drugs such as <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> , and thus the blood concentrations of the drugs are abnormally increased.
In another article of this issue, we have reported that <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> is metabolized by CYP2D6-Val and CYP3A4, and simultaneously inhibits the metabolism of the model substrates for these enzymes.
In this study, we performed the kinetic analysis of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> metabolism using microsomes prepared from human liver, and found that the Km and Vmax values were 26.1 microM and 1254.4 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively.
These observations, together with the finding that the putative highest concentration of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> in blood was congruent with 40 ng/ml ( congruent with 93 nM) at 4 h after each dosage during consecutive 6-d administration, encouraged us to conclude that <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> won't inhibit CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at clinical doses.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , one of the representative inhibitors for CYP3A4, potently inhibited the metabolism of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> ,but other well-known CYP inhibitor did not show significant inhibition .
These results suggest that the metabolism of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> is principally catalyzed by CYP3A4.
Furthermore, <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> inhibited the metabolism of (+/-) <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , model substrates for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner with the Ki values of 57.4 and 24.3 microM, respectively.
Cytochrome P450 3A-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> in human liver microsomes.
This study was carried out to determine the metabolic pathways of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> and cytochrome P450 (P450) isoform(s) responsible for <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> metabolism in human liver microsomes (HLMs).
 <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> mainly underwent N-dealkylation to 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP), N-oxidation on the <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> ring to <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> N-oxide (Bu N-oxide), and hydroxylation to 3'-hydroxybuspirone (3'-OH-Bu), 5-hydroxybuspirone ( <START:DRUG> 5-OH <END> -Bu), and 6'-hydroxybuspirone (6'-OH-Bu) in HLMs.
The apparent K(m) values for <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> metabolite formation in pooled HLMs were 8.7 (1-PP), 34.0 (Bu N-oxide), 4.3 (3'-OH-Bu), 11.4/514 ( <START:DRUG> 5-OH <END> -Bu), and <START:DRUG> 8.8 microM <END> (6'-OH-Bu).
Recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 exhibited buspironeoxidation activities among nine P450 isoforms tested.
The overall metabolism rate of 5 microMbuspirone by CYP3A4 was 18-foldgreater than that by CYP2D6 and 35-foldgreater than that by CYP3A5.
The metabolism rates of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> in CYP2D6 poor-metabolizer genotype HLMs were comparable to those in pooled HLMs.
Taken together, these data suggest that CYP3A, mostly likely CYP3A4, is primarily responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> in HLMs.
CYP3A inhibitor <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (1 microM) completely inhibited the formation of all major metabolites in HLMs (0-16% of control),whereas the chemical inhibitor selective to other P450 isoforms had little or no inhibitory effect.
In a panel of HLMs from 16 donors, <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> metabolism correlated well CYP3A activity (r2 = 0.85-0.96, rho < 0.0005),but not the activities of other P450 isoforms.
Characterization of human cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> perospirone <END> .
In vitro studies were carried out to identify the major contribution of CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 to the metabolism of <START:DRUG> perospirone <END> (cis-N- [4- [4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboximide monohydrochloride dehydrate), a novel antipsychotic agent, using human liver microsomes and expressed P450 isoforms.
With expressed P450s, K(m) and V(max) values were 1.09 microM and 1.93 pmol/min/pmol P450 for CYP2C8, 1.38 microM and 5.73 pmol/min/pmol P450 for CYP2D6, and 0.245 microM and 61.3 pmol/min/pmol P450 for CYP3A4, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (a specific inhibitor of CYP2D6) did not markedly affect the metabolism of <START:DRUG> perospirone <END> ,whereas <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) caused a decrease in the metabolism with human liver microsomes in a concentration dependent fashion.
With 10 microMquercetin, the metabolism of <START:DRUG> perospirone <END> was inhibited by 60.0% and with 1 microMketoconazole almost complete inhibition was apparent.
Anti-CYP2C8 and anti-CYP2D6 antisera did not exert marked effects, whereas anti-CYP3A4 antiserum caused almost complete inhibition.
These results indicated that the metabolism of <START:DRUG> perospirone <END> in human liver was mainly catalysed by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 were responsible because kinetic data (K(m) and V(max)) of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 suggested catalytic potential.
CYP isoforms involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> in vitro: comparison between the identification from disappearance rate and that from formation rate of metabolites.
To clarify whether CYP2C19 is involved in the overall metabolism of <START:DRUG> clarithromycin <END> (CAM) or not, in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYPs were performed by an approach based on the disappearance rate of parent compound from the incubation mixture.
In addition, the results of disappearance rate were compared with those obtained from the formation rates of the major metabolites of CAM , 14-(R)-hydroxy-CAM and <START:DRUG> n-demethyl-CAM <END> .
These results were fairly consistent with those obtained from the conventional approach based on the formation of major metabolites of CAM.
Comparison of the kinetic parameters estimated from the disappearance rate of CAM and the formation rates of 14-(R)-hydroxy-CAM and <START:DRUG> n-demethyl-CAM <END> indicates that N-demethylation and 14-(R)-hydroxylation account for 65% of CL(int) derived from the disappearance of CAM in human liver microsomes.
A combination of the disappearance rate of a parent compound and the formation rate of metabolites appears to be a useful approach for estimating the percentage contribution of the formation of metabolites to the overall metabolic clearance of a parent compound in vitro.
The intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) values determined from the disappearance of CAM in nine different human liver microsomes were highly correlated with the <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activity (r=0.957, p<0.001).
The CL(int) of CAM was markedly reduced by selective inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> ) and by polyclonal antibodies raised against CYP3A4/5 in human liver microsomes.
Among the 11 isoforms of recombinant human CYP, only CYP3A4 revealed the metabolic activity for the disappearance of CAM .
The findings suggest that CYP3A4 plays a predominant role in the overall metabolic clearance of CAM as well as in the formation of 14-(R)-hydroxy-CAM and <START:DRUG> n-demethyl-CAM <END> .
CYP2C19 does not appear to be involved in the overall metabolism of CAM at least in human liver microsomes.
Application of microtiter plate assay to evaluate inhibitory effects of various compounds on nine cytochrome P450 isoforms and to estimate their inhibition patterns.
Using a microtiter plate (MTP) assay consists of recombinant cytochromes P450 and fluorescent probes, we evaluated inhibitory effects of commercially available model-compounds, 18 typical substrates and 8 selective inhibitors, on nine cytochromes P450 (CYPs) activities.
The IC(50) values obtained from the assay were used to estimate inhibition constant (Ki) values, assuming competitive inhibition.
The Ki values calculated from IC(50) (the Ki(-cal) ) with the MTP assay using recombinant CYPs were compared with the Ki values (the Ki (-rep) ), reported for human liver microsomes (HLM).
Regarding all the inhibitory effects of the 26 test compounds on each CYP activity, a good correlation (r(2)=0.7306) was found between Ki(-cal) and Ki(-rep) .
The inhibitory patterns of some compounds on the five major CYP isoforms were estimated, using the MTP assay with the preincubation method.
Therefore, the MTP assay is a useful high throughput screening method to evaluate inhibitory effects of new drug candidates on 9 CYP isoforms in HLM.
In addition, the MTP assay with the preincubation method might be beneficial to estimate inhibitory patterns on CYP isoforms of new drug candidates and to estimate main CYP isoforms responsible for metabolism of these compounds.
 <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , both mechanism based inhibitors , strongly inhibited CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity, respectively and their inhibitory effects increased depending on the preincubation time.
In contrast, the inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> , <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> and <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> , typical substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively, on each recombinant CYP activity decreased after preincubation.
In vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> by human, mouse, and rat cytochrome P450 and interactions with <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , and <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> .
 <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> is a carbamate pesticide used in agricultural practice throughout the world.
Its effect as a pesticide is due to its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity.
Though <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> has a long history of use, there is little information available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals.
The present study was designed to investigate the comparative in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> from human, rat, and mouse liver microsomes (HLM, RLM, MLM, respectively), and characterize the specific enzymes involved in such metabolism, with particular reference to human metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) leading to the production of one major ring oxidation metabolite, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, and two minor metabolites.
The affinity of <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> for CYP enzymes involved in the oxidation to 3-hydroxycarbofuran is significantly less in HLM (Km=1.950 mM) than in RLM (Km=0.210 mM), or MLM (Km=0.550 mM).
Intrinsic clearance rate calculations indicate that HLM are 14-fold less efficient in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> to 3-hydroxycarbofuran than RLM or MLM.
A screen of 15 major human CYP isoforms for metabolic ability with respect to <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism demonstrated that CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> oxidation in humans.
CYP1A2 and 2C19 are much less active while other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> .
In contrast with the human isoforms, members of the CYP2C family in rats are likely to have a primary role in <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism.
Normalization of HLM data with the average levels of each CYP in native HLM, indicates that <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 (percent total normalized rate (% TNR)=77.5), although CYP1A2 and 2C19 play ancillary roles (% TNR=9.0 and 6.0, respectively).
This is substantiated by the fact that <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, is an excellent inhibitor of 3-hydroxycarbofuran formation in HLM (IC50: 0.31 microM).
 <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , an irreversible non-competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the formation of 3-hydroxycarbofuran in HLM (IC50: 39 microM).
The use of phenotyped HLM demonstrated that individuals with high levels of CYP3A4 have the greatest potential to metabolize <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> to its major metabolite.
The variation in <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism among 17 single-donor HLM samples is over 5-fold and the best correlation between CYP isoform activity and <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism was observed with CYP3A4 (r2=0.96).
The interaction of <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> and the endogenous CYP3A4 substrates, <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> , were also investigated.
 <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> metabolism was activated by <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> in HLM and CYP3A4, however, less activation was observed for <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> metabolism by <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> in HLM and CYP3A4.
No interactions between <START:DRUG> carbofuran <END> and <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolism were observed.

 <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> enantiomer activates human liver microsomal CYP2C9 catalytic activity in a stereospecific and substrate-specific manner.
We recently proposed a possible stereoselective activation by <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> of CYP2C9-catalyzedtolbutamide hydroxylation, as well as stereoselective inhibition of several cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms.
This study evaluated the effects of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> enantiomers on CYP2C9 activity in vitro, using several probe substrates.
R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> -mediated activation of the formation of 4-hydroxyphenytoin was also seen with recombinant human CYP2C9.
Kinetic parameters were also estimated using the two-site binding equation, with alpha values <1 and beta values >1, indicative of activation.
These substrate-dependent activation effects suggest that <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> has a different binding orientation compared with <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> and S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
Overall, these results suggest that R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> activates CYP2C9 in a stereospecific and substrate-specific manner, possibly by binding within the active site and inducing positive cooperativity.
This is the first report to describe stereoselective activation of this cytochrome P450 isoform.
For <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> 4-hydroxylation, R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> was an activator (140 and 550% of control at 100 microM R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> , EC50 values of 19.9 and 30.2 microM , respectively).
R-Lansoprazoleincreased the Michaelis-Menten-derived V(max) of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> 4-hydroxylation from 0.024 to 0.121 pmol/min/pmol P450, and lowered its K(m) from 20.5 to 15.0 microM , suggesting that R-lansoprazoleactivatesCYP2C9-mediated <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> metabolism without displacing <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> from the active site.
Additionally, <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> at 10 to 200 microM had no reciprocal effect on the hydroxylation of R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> .
Meanwhile, R- <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> had no activation effect on <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> and S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> metabolism in the incubation study using both recombinant CYP2C9 and human liver microsomes.
Mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A by HIV protease inhibitors .
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs) are inhibitors of CYP3A enzymes, but the mechanism is poorly defined.
In this study, time- and concentration-dependent decreases in activity as defined by maximum rate of inactivation (k(inact)) and inhibitor concentration that gives 50% maximal inactivation(K(I)) of CYP3A by <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> , <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , and <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> were quantified using <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation as a marker for CYP3A activity with recombinant CYP3A4(+b(5)), recombinant CYP3A5, and pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs).
Spectrophototmetrically determined metabolic intermediate complex formation was observed for all of the PIs with CYP3A4(+b(5)), except for <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> .
The addition of nucleophilic and free aldehyde trapping agents and free iron and reactive oxygen species scavengers did not prevent inactivation of CYP3A4(+b(5)) by <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> , or <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , but <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> decreased the inactivation by <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> (17%) and catalase decreased the inactivation by <START:DRUG> lopinavir <END> (39%).
In conclusion, all the PIs exhibited mechanism-based inactivation, and predictions of the extent and time course of drug interactions with PIs could be underestimated if based solely on reversible inhibition.
All the PIs, except <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , displayed inactivation with CYP3A4(+b(5)) and HLMs.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was the most potent (K(I) = 0.10 and 0.17 microM ) and demonstrated high k(inact) values ( 0.32 and 0.40 min(-1)) with both CYP3A4(+b(5)) and HLMs.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was not significantly depleted by high-affinity binding with CYP3A4(+b(5)) and confirmed that estimation of reversible inhibition was confounded with irreversible inhibition.
For CYP3A5, <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> exhibited the highest k(inact) (0.47 min(-1) ), but <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was the most potent (K(I) = 0.12 microM ).
 <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> did not show time- and concentration-dependent decreases in activity with CYP3A5.
Cyp2D6 catalyzes 5-hydroxylation of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)- <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> , an active metabolite of several psychoactive drugs, in human liver microsomes.
1-(2-Pyrimidinyl)- <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> (1-PP) is an active metabolite of several psychoactive drugs including <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> .
1-PP is also the major metabolite in the human circulation and in rat brains following oral administration of <START:DRUG> buspirone <END> .
This study was conducted to identify the enzyme responsible for the metabolic conversion of 1-PP to 5-hydroxy-1-(2-pyrimidinyl) - <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> ( <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> ) in human liver microsomes (HLMs).
The product <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> was quantified by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.
In the presence of NADPH, 1-PP (100 microM) was incubated separately with human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes (including CYP2D6, 3A4, 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and 2B6) at 37 degrees C.
The formation of <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> followed a Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K(m) of 171 microM and V(max) of 313 pmol/min x mg protein in HLMs.
Collectively, these results indicate that polymorphic CYP2D6 is responsible for the conversion of 1-PP to <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> .
CYP2D6catalyzed the formation of <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> from 1-PP .
This catalytic activity was >95% inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a CYP2D6 inhibitor.
 <START:DRUG> hO-1-PP <END> formation rates correlated well with the <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1-hydroxylase (CYP2D6) activities of individual HLMs.
Non-specific inhibition of human cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions by hemin.
Hemin, a stable form of <START:DRUG> heme <END> , is known to have an antimutagenic effect.
Inhibitory effects of hemin on the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed reactions of human liver microsomes and reconstituted systems containing purified CYP and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (NPR) were seen.
Hemin non-specifically inhibited all of the microsomal CYP activities examined.
Spectrally detectable CYP was destroyed in human liver microsomes and in a reconstituted system in the presence of hemin and an NADPH-generating system.
We propose that the antimutagenic effect of hemin might be due to inhibition of CYP and NPR enzymes involved in the bioactivation of mutagens.
Hemin also inhibited 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation, 3- [2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylammonium)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin O-demethylation, and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation catalyzed by purified CYPs 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4, with IC50 values of 27, 19, and 2.4 microM, respectively.
Hemin also inhibited reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide by NPR, as much as 47%.
Potential of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> and <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> in the inhibition of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes.
1.
The potential of <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> to inhibit several human cytochrome P450 enzymes is well known.
However, <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> , a structural analogue of <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> , has not been studied.
Accordingly, the inhibitory potential of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> was evaluated and compared with that of <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> , a known CYP2C9 inhibitor , in in vitro microsomal incubation studies.
2.

4.
Both <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> and <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C9-catalysed <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation, competitively inhibiting <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation with estimated mean K(i) values of 3.82 +/- 0.50 and 5.86 +/- 0.08 microM , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> had no effect on CYP2C19- catalysed S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation or CYP3A4-catalysed <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1-hydroxylation.
However, <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> showed minorinhibition of these reactions.
Neither <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> nor <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> inhibited CYP1A2-catalysed <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation, CYP2D6-catalysed <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation or CYP2E1-catalysed <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation.
The results suggest that like <START:DRUG> zafirlukast <END> , <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> also has the potential moderately to inhibit CYP2C9-catalysed <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation.
Therefore, the inhibitory potential of <START:DRUG> pranlukast <END> should be considered when it is co-administered with CYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g. S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> ).
CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 are responsible for the in vitro N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> meperidine <END> in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> meperidine <END> is an opioid analgesic metabolized in the liver by N-demethylation to <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> , a potent stimulant of the central nervous system.
The purpose of this study was to identify the human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes involved in <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> formation.
Our in vitro studies included 1) screening 16 expressed P450s for <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> formation, 2) kinetic experiments on human liver microsomes and candidate P450s, and 3) correlation and inhibition experiments using human hepatic microsomes.
After normalization by its relative abundance in human liver microsomes, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 accounted for 57, 28, and 15% of the total intrinsic clearance of <START:DRUG> meperidine <END> .
CYP3A5 and CYP2D6 contributed to < 1%.
In contrast, antibodies inhibitory to CYP3A4 and CYP2C8/9/18/19 had little effect (<14% inhibition).
Formation of <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> significantlycorrelated with CYP2B6-selective S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> N-demethylation (r = 0.88, p < 0.0001 at 75 > microMmeperidine, and r = 0.89, p < 0.0001 at 350 microMmeperidine, n = 21) and CYP3A4-selective <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation (r = 0.59, p < 0.01 at 75 microMmeperidine, and r = 0.55, p < 0.01 at 350 microMmeperidine, n = 23).
No significantcorrelation was observed with CYP2C19-selective S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation (r = 0.36, p = 0.2 at 75 microMmeperidine, and r = 0.02, p = 0.9 at 350 microMmeperidine, n = 13).
An anti-CYP2B6 antibody inhibited <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> formation by 46%.
Experiments with <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> suggested inhibition of microsomal CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 activity, whereas studies with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> (a substrate of CYP2C19) were inconclusive due to lack of specificity.
We conclude that <START:DRUG> normeperidine <END> formation in human liver microsomes is mainly catalyzed by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, with a minor contribution from CYP2C19.
Comparison of inhibitory effects of the proton pump- inhibiting drugs <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> esomeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> on human cytochrome P450 activities.
The human clearance of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) of the substituted <START:DRUG> benzimidazole <END> class is conducted primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) system.
To compare the potency and specificity of the currently used PPIs (i.e., <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> esomeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> ) as inhibitors of four cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), we performed in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations and recombinant CYP2C19.
Sample analysis was done using selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectometry.
Our data suggest that, although the inhibitory profiles of the five studied PPIs were similar, <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> are the most potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> esomeprazole <END> showed less inhibitory potency compared with <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and its R-enantiomer.
The inhibitory potency of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> was relatively lower than the other PPIs, but its thioether analog showed potent inhibition on the P450 enzymes investigated, which may be clinically significant.
With several systems for CYP2C19 activity (two marker reactions, S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation and R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 5-hydroxylation, tested in either human liver microsomes or recombinant CYP2C19), the five PPIs showed competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 activity with K(i) of 0.4 to 1.5 microM for <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> , 2 to 6 microM for <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , approximately 8 microM for <START:DRUG> esomeprazole <END> , 14 to 69 microM for <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> , and 17 to 21 microM for <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> pantoprazole <END> was a competitive inhibitor of both CYP2C9-catalyzeddiclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzedmidazolam 1'-hydroxylation (K(i) of 6 and 22 microM , respectively), which were at least 2 times more potent than the other PPIs.
All PPIs were poor inhibitors of CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation with IC(50) > 200 microM .
The inhibitory potency of a nonenzymatically formed product of <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> , <START:DRUG> rabeprazole <END> thioether, was also investigated and showed potent, competitive inhibition with K(i) values of 6 microM for CYP2C9, 2 to 8 microM for CYP2C19, 12 microM for CYP2D6, and 15 microM for CYP3A4.
The inhibitory potency of R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> on the four studied P450 enzymes was also studied and showed higher inhibitory potency than its S-isomer on CYP2C9 and 2C19 activities.
Differences in the induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by taxane anticancer drugs, <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> , assessed employing primary human hepatocytes.
The induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by drugs and other xenobiotics is a common cause of serious drug interactions.
The aim of this study was to comparatively examine the effects of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> , two structurally related taxane anticancer agents, on the activity and expression of hepatic CYP3A4.
Employing primary cultures of human hepatocytes from multiple donors, we investigated the differences in the magnitude of CYP3A4induction and relative accumulation of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
The CYP3A4 activity of intact hepatocytes was measured as the rate of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation.
The CYP3A4-specific immunoreactive protein and mRNA levels were measured employing Western blot and Northern blot analysis, respectively.
Furthermore, employing cell-based reporter gene assay in CV-1 cells, we evaluated the capacity of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> to activate human pregnane X receptor (hPXR), an orphan nuclear receptor that plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4.
A comparison of the cellular concentrations of <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> , in the cell culture models employed for evaluating CYP3A4induction and hPXR activation, revealed that the intracellular <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> levels were three-fold higher than that of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
Thus, it appears that both pharmacokinetic (drug concentration) and pharmacodynamic differences (hPXR activation) may account for the observed differences in CYP3Ainduction by <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> and <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
Our studies suggest that <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> has markedly reduced propensity to cause drug interactions that may entail hepatic CYP3A4induction.
In concurrence with previous reports, we observed that <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> potently induced CYP3A4 activity and expression in hepatocytes treated for 48-96 h.
However, <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> did not increase the activity or the CYP3A4 immunoreactive protein levels for treatment periods up to 96 h.
"
A marginal increase in the CYP3A4 mRNA levels was observed in cells treated with higher levels (5 and 10 microM) of <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> .
Furthermore, while <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> effectively activated hPXR (the half-maximal effective concentration, EC50 , being about 5.2 microM), <START:DRUG> docetaxel <END> weakly activated hPXR, and moreover the activation occurred only at high concentrations relative to <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> .
Selective inhibition of CYP2B6-catalyzedbupropion hydroxylation in human liver microsomes in vitro.
Some inhibitory agents against CYP2B6 have been reported, but none of these has been extensively characterized or compared with others, as to the potency and selectivity of inhibition toward CYP2B6.
The goal of this work was to find a selective and potent chemical in vitro inhibitor toward CYP2B6 using <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation as a model reaction.
At the initial screening of more than 30 substances, <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> , triethylenethiophosphoramide ( <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> ), <START:DRUG> metyrapone <END> , <START:DRUG> xanthate C8 <END> , and <START:DRUG> benzylisothiocyanate <END> displayed IC(50) values of <10 microM and were selected for a more detailed analysis.
 <START:DRUG> metyrapone <END> , <START:DRUG> xanthate C8 <END> , and <START:DRUG> benzylisothiocyanate <END> inhibited several other cytochrome P450 activities rather effectively, some of them even more potently than CYP2B6, and consequently are unsuitable as CYP2B6-selective probes.
Thus, although both compounds proved to be relatively potent inhibitors of CYP2B6, <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> was about 2 orders of magnitude more selective than <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> .
Thus, <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> is a drug of choice when high CYP2B6 selectivity among major P450 enzymes is required.
 <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> is a useful alternative under a controlled experimental setup and when higher potency is needed.
 <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> and <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> were the most potent inhibitors of <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation with K(i) values of 0.2 and 2.8 microM , respectively.
The inhibition type of <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> was found to be mixed type, with a component of mechanism-based inhibition, whereas <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> inhibited CYP2B6 in a competitive manner.
In addition to CYP2B6, <START:DRUG> ticlopidine <END> also inhibited both <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19) (IC(50) , 2.7 microM ) and <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6) (IC(50) , 4.4 microM ).
For <START:DRUG> thiotepa <END> the next sensitive P450 activity after CYP2B6 was <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation ( IC(50), 256 microM).
Identification of human p450 isoforms involved in the metabolism of the antiallergic drug, <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> , and its inhibitory effect on enzyme activity.
 <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> is an antiallergic drug used for the treatment of diseases mediated by type I allergy.
Recently, it has been reported that <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> , which have antiallergic actions similar to those of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> , show side effects on the cardiovascular system, such as QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.
This might be because concomitant drugs such as <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the enzyme responsible for degradation of <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> astemizole <END> , and thus the blood concentrations of the drugs are abnormally increased .
On the other hand, isoforms of P450 involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> have not been clarified.
Therefore, we attempted to identify these isoforms using microsome preparations of in vitro expression systems derived from a human lymphoblastoid cell line.
 <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> was metabolized by CYP2D6-Val and CYP3A4, but not by CYP1A2, CYP2C9-Arg, CYP2C9-Cys or CYP2C19 .
We also examined whether <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> showed inhibitory effects on metabolic activity of individual P450 isozymes using model substrates for each isozyme.
 <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> did not inhibit the metabolism of the model substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9-Arg, CYP2C9-Cys and CYP2C19, but inhibited the degradation of those for CYP2D6-Val and CYP3A4 .
It was found that <START:DRUG> oxatomide <END> is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes, and simultaneously acts as an inhibitor for these isoforms, responsible for the metabolism of the drug itself.
Interaction of <START:DRUG> dexloxiglumide <END> , a cholecystokinin type-1 receptor antagonist, with human cytochromes P450.
 <START:DRUG> dexloxiglumide <END> (DEX) is a cholecystokinin type-1 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
Studies of the potential interaction of DEX with human cytochromes P450 (CYPs) were conducted in vitro.
DEX (300 micro M) , both with and without a 15-min pre-incubation, was incubated with pooled human liver microsomes and substrates selective for each of eight CYPs.
Mean K(i) (SD) for CYP2C9/10 and CYP2E1 were 69.0 (24.3) and 426 (60) microM , respectively.
Incubations of [(14)C]DEX with pooled human liver microsomes produced one major phase I metabolic fraction, with V(max) =131 pmol/min/mg protein and K(m) = 23.7 microM .
Further incubations with (i) liver microsomes from 16 individual donors (correlation analysis), (ii) Supersomes trade mark and (iii) selective chemical inhibitors , implicated CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 in the formation of this component.
However, based on the maximum concentration (27 microM ) after repeated oral doses of 200 mg t.i.d.
and the unbound fraction (0.03) of DEX in human plasma, no clinically relevant metabolic interactions with other CYP substrates are predicted.
This resulted in >30% inhibition of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methyl-hydroxylase (CYP2C9/10) and <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid 11-hydroxylase (CYP2E1) activities.
Thus, DEX interacts with CYP2C9 both as inhibitor (K(i) = 69.0 microM ) and as substrate in vitro.
Effect of <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> , a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on cytochrome P450 activities in human hepatic microsomes.
The effects of <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> , a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities in human hepatic microsomes were investigated.
The free fractions of <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> in the incubation mixture estimated by ultracentrifugation were 18.9-27.4%.
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> would not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs, which are metabolized by CYPs, via the inhibition of metabolism .
 <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> competitively inhibited CYP1A2-mediated 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase, CYP2A6-mediated <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylase, CYP2C8/9-mediated <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> methylhydroxylase, CYP2C19-mediated S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase, and CYP3A4-mediated <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidase activities, and the inhibition constant (Ki) values were 13.0, 35.8, 5.02, 24.5 and 44.3 microM , respectively.
On the other hand, no inhibition of CYP2B6-mediated 7- <START:DRUG> benzyloxyresorufin <END> O-debenzylation, CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation, or CYP2E1-mediated <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation by <START:DRUG> nilvadipine <END> at 40 microM concentration was observed.
Regulation of CYP2B6 in primary human hepatocytes by prototypical inducers.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of 14 compounds, which differentially activate human pregnane X receptor (hPXR), to induce CYP2B6 expression and to compare CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 concentration- and time-dependent induction by select inducers.
Three primary human hepatocyte preparations were treated daily for 3 days with three concentrations of all compounds.
Additional concentration- and/or time-response studies were conducted with <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> in six preparations.
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 protein and activities were assessed by Western blotting, <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation, and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation, respectively.
To evaluate hPXR activation by the 14 compounds, reporter gene assays were conducted using Huh7 cells cotransfected with hPXR and a CYP2B6 (NR1)5-LUC reporter plasmid.
EC50 values for CYP2B6 and CYP3A4induction by <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.99) and were statistically indistinguishable for <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
Kinetic constants governing time-dependent induction by <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> were also similar between CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.
These results indicate that CYP2B6 is highly inducible by known CYP3A4 inducers and suggest that hPXR is a major determinant of CYP2B6-inducible expression for many, but not all, compounds evaluated in this study.
 <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> strongly induced CYP2B6 and activated hPXR; <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> t-butylacetate and <START:DRUG> sulfinpyrazone <END> induced CYP2B6 weakly and activated hPXR moderately; <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> strongly activated hPXR but did not increaseCYP2B6 expression <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> and phenytoinmoderately or strongly increased CYP2B6 expression but weakly activated hPXR; and <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> , <START:DRUG> methotrexate <END> , <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfadimidine <END> , and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> demonstrated weak or negligible effects on CYP2B6 and hPXR.
The olivacine derivative <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> (9-hydroxy-5,6-dimethyl-N- [2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-6H-pyrido(4,3-B)-carbazole-1-carboxamide)inducesCYP1A and its own metabolism in human hepatocytes in primary culture.
The olivacine derivative 9-hydroxy-5,6-dimethyl-N- [2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-6H-pyrido(4,3-b)-carbazole-1-carboxamide ( <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> ) exhibits a potent antitumor activity.
However, when administered in cancer patients, its blood clearance increases after repeated administrations, whereas the volume of distribution remains constant, suggesting that the drug is able toinduce its own metabolism .
The aim of this work was to identify the enzymes involved in <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> metabolism and determine whether this molecule is an enzyme inducer in human hepatocytes in primary cultures.
Among a battery of cDNA-expressed cytochromes P450 (P450s) and flavin monooxygenase (FMO), only CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and FMO3 were able to generate detectable amounts of metabolites of <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> .
In primary hepatocytes, pretreatment of cells with <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> or TCDD produced a significant and similar increase of <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> metabolism , consistent with the previous indications on the role of CYP1As.
We conclude that CYP1As and FMO3 are the major phase I enzymes involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> and that this molecule is a potent hydrocarbon-like inducer able to stimulate its own metabolism in primary human hepatocytes and liver.
In primary hepatocytes, <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> behaved as a CYP1A inducer , producing an increase in CYP1A2 protein, <START:DRUG> acetanilide <END> 4-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation, and <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation to an extent similar to that of <START:DRUG> 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin <END> (TCDD), a prototypical CYP1A inducer.
The levels of other P450 proteins, including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, and related activities were not affected by <START:DRUG> s 16020 <END> .
Dose-dependent induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and activation of pregnane X receptor by <START:DRUG> topiramate <END> .
In clinical studies, <START:DRUG> topiramate <END> (TPM) was shown to cause a dose-dependent increase in the clearance of ethinyl <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> .
We hypothesized that this interaction results from induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by TPM.
Accordingly, we investigated whether TPM induces CYP3A4 in primary human hepatocytes and activates the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR), a nuclear receptor that serves as a regulator of CYP3A4 transcription.
Human hepatocytes were treated for 72 h with TPM (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 microM) and known inducers , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> (PB; 2 mM), and <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> (10 microM).
The rate of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation by hepatocytes served as a marker for CYP3A4 activity.
The CYP3A4-specific protein and mRNA levels were determined by using Western and Northern blot analyses, respectively.
The hPXR activation was assessed with cell-based reporter gene assay.
It also is suggestive of other potential interactions when high-dose TPM therapy is used.
Compared with controls, TPM (50-500 microM)-treated hepatocytes exhibited a considerable increase in the CYP3A4 activity (1.6- to 8.2-fold), protein levels (4.6- to 17.3-fold), and mRNA levels (1.9- to 13.3-fold).
Comparatively, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> (10 microM) effected 14.5-, 25.3-, and a 20.3-fold increase in CYP3A4 activity, immunoreactive protein levels, and mRNA levels, respectively.
TPM (50-500 microM) caused 1.3- to 3-foldactivation of the hPXR, whereas <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> (10 microM) caused a 6-foldactivation.
The observed induction of CYP3A4 by TPM , especially at the higher concentrations, provides a potential mechanistic explanation of the reported increase in the ethinyl <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> clearance by TPM.
Human cytochrome p450 inhibition and metabolic-intermediate complex formation by goldenseal extract and its methylenedioxyphenyl components.
The concurrent use of herbal medicinals with prescription and over-the-counter drugs carries a risk for unanticipated adverse drug-botanical pharmacokinetic interactions, particularly as a result of cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibition.
Extracts of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) containing approximately equal concentrations ( approximately 17 mM) of two methylenedioxyphenyl alkaloids, <START:DRUG> berberine <END> and hydrastine, inhibited with increasing potency (CYP2C9) <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation, (CYP2D6) <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation, and (CYP3A4) <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activities in human hepatic microsomes.
The inhibition of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activity was noncompetitive with an apparent Ki of 0.11% extract.
Of the methylenedioxyphenyl alkaloids, <START:DRUG> berberine <END> (IC50 = 45 microM) was the more inhibitory toward <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation and hydrastine (IC50 approximately 350 microM for both isomers), toward <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation.
For <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> berberine <END> was the least inhibitory component (IC50 approximately 400 microM).
Hydrastine inhibited <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation with IC50 values for the (+)- and (-)-isomers of 25 and 30 microM, respectively.
For (-)-hydrastine, an apparent Ki value of 18 microM without preincubation and an NADPH-dependent mechanism-based inhibition with a <START:DRUG> kinactivation <END> of 0.23 min(-1) and a KI of approximately 110 microM were determined.
Cytochrome P450 metabolic-intermediate (MI) complex formation could be demonstrated for both hydrastine isomers.
With expressed P450 isoforms, hydrastine formed a P450 MI complex with CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Coexpression of cytochrome b5 with the P450 isoforms enhanced the rate but not the extent of P450 MI complex formation.

Mechanism-based inhibition of human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 1A2 by <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> , a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor .
 <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> , a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor , was evaluated as an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 activity in human liver microsomes.
The effect was NADPH-, time-, and concentration-dependent, and was characterized by a kinact (maximal rate of enzyme inactivation) and apparent KI (inhibitor concentration that supports half the maximal rate of inactivation) of 0.035 min(-1) and 117 microM , respectively (kinact/KIratio of 0.0003 min-1 microM(-1)).
In addition, the inhibition of CYP1A2 was not reversed in the presence of reduced <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> , catalase, and superoxide dismutase and was refractory to dialysis.
In the absence of preincubation, the racemate was found to be a weak inhibitor ( IC50> 100 microM) of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (POD) (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylation (CYP2C8), <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> bupropion <END> hydroxylation (CYP2B6).
When preincubated with NADPH-fortified human liver microsomes in the absence of substrate, <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> (racemate) was shown to inhibit POD.
Preincubation-dependent inhibition of POD activity was also observed with the individual (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)-enantiomers of <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> [(S)-(-)- <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> ; kinact , 0.037 min(-1) , KI , 98.2 microM , kinact/KIratio , 0.0004 min(-1) microM(-1) ; (R)-(+)- <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> ; kinact , 0.012 min(-1), KI , 66.6 microM , kinact/KIratio, 0.0002 min(-1) microM(-1)].
Therefore, <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> was characterized as a mechanism-based inhibitor of human liver microsomal CYP1A2.
Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP1A2may explain why <START:DRUG> zileuton <END> decreases the oral clearance of <START:DRUG> antipyrine <END> , <START:DRUG> propranolol <END> , (R)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> , and <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> , at doses that have a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of (S)- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> , <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , and <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> .
Identification of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 4'-methoxy-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MOPPP) , a designer drug, in human liver microsomes.
1.
The metabolism of 4'-methoxy-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MOPPP) , a novel designer drug, to its demethylated major metabolite 4'-hydroxy-pyrrolidinopropio-phenone ( <START:DRUG> hO-PPP <END> ) was studied in pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) and in cDNA-expressed human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
2.
CYP2C19 catalysed the demethylation with apparent Km and Vmax values of 373.4 +/- 45.1 microM and 6.0 +/- 0.3 pmol min(-1) pmol(-1) CYP, respectively (mean +/- SD).
Both CYP2D6 and HLM exhibited clear biphasic profiles with apparent K(m,1) values of 1.3 +/- 0.4 and 22.0 +/- 6.5 microM , respectively, and V(max,1) values of 1.1 +/- 0.1 pmol min(-1) pmol(-1) CYP and 169.1 +/- 20.5 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively.
3.
Percentages of intrinsic clearances of MOPPP by particular CYPs were calculated using the relative activity factor (RAF) approach with (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> -4'-hydroxylation or <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> -1'-hydroxylation as index reactions for CYP2C19 or CYP2D6, respectively.
4.
MOPPP, <START:DRUG> hO-PPP <END> and the standard 3',4'-methylenedioxy-pyrrolidinopropio-phenone (MDPPP) were separated and analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode.
5.
6.
It can be concluded from the data obtained from kinetic and inhibition studies that polymorphically expressed CYP2D6 is the enzyme mainly responsible for MOPPP demethylation.
The CYP2D6 specific chemical inhibitor <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (3 microM) significantly (p<0.0001) inhibited <START:DRUG> hO-PPP <END> formation by 91.8 +/- 0.5% (mean +/- SEM) in incubation mixtures with HLM and 2 microM MOPPP.
Cytochrome P450 2C8 and CYP3A4/5 are involved in <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> metabolism in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> has been used for many decades in the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria.
It is metabolized in humans through the N-dealkylation pathway, to <START:DRUG> desethylchloroquine <END> (DCQ) and <START:DRUG> bisdesethylchloroquine <END> (BDCQ), by cytochrome P450 (CYP).
However, until recently, no data are available on the metabolic pathway of <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> .
Therefore, the metabolic pathway of <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> was evaluated using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs.
 <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> is mainly metabolized to DCQ , and its Eadie-Hofstee plots were biphasic, indicating the involvement of multiple enzymes, with apparent Km and Vmax values of 0.21 mM and 1.02 nmol/min/mg protein 3.43 mM and 10.47 nmol/min/mg protein for high and low affinity components, respectively.
Of the cDNA-expressing CYPs examined, CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5 exhibited significant DCQ formation.
In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 are the major enzymes responsible for the <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> N-deethylation to DCQ in human liver microsomes.
A study using chemical inhibitors showed only <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> (a CYP2C8 inhibitor ) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor ) inhibited the DCQ formation.
In addition, the DCQ formation significantlycorrelated with the CYP3A4/5-catalyzedmidazolam 1-hydroxylation (r = 0.868) and CYP2C8-catalyzedpaclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (r = 0.900).
A screening study on the liability of eight different female sex steroids to inhibit CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 activities in human liver microsomes.
The aim of this study was to screen the inhibitory potential of different clinically used <START:DRUG> oestrogen <END> and <START:DRUG> progestin <END> hormones on CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 activities in human liver microsomes.
The degree of inhibition by <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> , <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> , <START:DRUG> 17-beta-oestradiol <END> , <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> , <START:DRUG> aethinyloestradiol <END> , <START:DRUG> medroxyprogesterone <END> acetate, <START:DRUG> norethisterone <END> or L- <START:DRUG> norgestrel <END> were studied at 100 microM on losartanoxidation (CYP2C9), R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 5'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19) and R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphoxidation (CYP3A4) with a 10-min preincubation with NADPH in human liver microsomes prepared from 6 individual genotyped donor livers.
In conclusion, the liability of clinically used female sex steroids to inhibit CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 activities in human liver microsomes is very distinctive and these differences among both the <START:DRUG> oestrogen <END> and <START:DRUG> progestin <END> hormones may, at least in part, explain the variable results from clinical trials examining inhibitory effects of hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives on drug metabolism .
 <START:DRUG> aethinyloestradiol <END> was found to be a potent inhibitor (55% mean inhibition ; 95% CI 32% to 79%) of losartanoxidation (CYP2C9) and R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 5-hydroxylation (70%; 63% to 77%) (CYP2C19),while it had little effect on R- <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulphoxidation (CYP3A4) activity.
 <START:DRUG> 17-beta-oestradiol <END> did not produce significant inhibition on any of the studied enzyme activities.
Of the <START:DRUG> progestin <END> hormones studied, <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> and <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> were potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (57%; 47% to 67% and 51%; 29% to 45%) and CYP3A4 (45%; 30% to 59% and 40%; 19% to 62%),but had little effect on the CYP2C9 activity.
In addition, <START:DRUG> medroxyprogesterone <END> acetate was found to inhibit CYP2C9 (55%; 45% to 65%),while not having significant effect on 2C19 or 3A4 .
Identification of CYP1A2 as the main isoform for the phase I hydroxylated metabolism of <START:DRUG> genistein <END> and a prodrug converting enzyme of methylated isoflavones.
This study determined the cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms responsible for metabolism of isoflavones using human liver microsomes (HLM) and expressed P450s.
The primary metabolite of <START:DRUG> genistein <END> is 3'-OH- <START:DRUG> genistein <END> , as identified with an authentic chemically synthesized standard.
The contribution of these P450s to the formation of 3'-OH- <START:DRUG> genistein <END> was also confirmed with a panel of expressed enzymes.
The conversion of biochanin A to <START:DRUG> genistein <END> appears to be mainly mediated by CYP1A2 because of the strong correlation between the conversion rates and CYP1A2 activities in HLM.
Thus, CYP1A2 is an effective prodrug-converting enzyme for less active methylated isoflavones.
In conclusion, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 metabolized <START:DRUG> genistein <END> and CYP1A2 acted as prodrug-converting enzymes for other less active methylated isoflavones.
CYP1A2 was predominantly responsible for 3'-OH- <START:DRUG> genistein <END> formation since its formation was inhibited (>50%, p < 0.05) by a monoclonal antibody specific for CYP1A2, was correlated with CYP1A2 activities of HLM, and was catalyzed by expressed CYP1A2.
In addition to CYP1A2, CYP2E1 also catalyzed, although to a lesser extent, its formation.
Methylated isoflavones biochanin A, prunetin, and formononetin (10-100 microM) were rapidly converted by HLM and expressed CYP1A2 to more active <START:DRUG> genistein <END> and daidzein.
CYP1A2-catalyzed conversion of biochanin A to <START:DRUG> genistein <END> (Km, 7.80 microM; Vmax, 903 pmol/min/mg of protein; Vmax/Km, 116 microl/min/mg of protein) was much faster than 3'-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> genistein <END> (Km, 12.7 microM and Vmax, 109 pmol/min/mg of protein; Vmax/Km, 8.6 microl/min/mg of protein).
The interaction studies showed that <START:DRUG> genistein <END> inhibited formation of <START:DRUG> acetaminophen <END> from <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> with an IC50 value of 16 microM.
Additional studies showed that <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> and <START:DRUG> genistein <END> were mutually inhibitory.
 <START:DRUG> eletriptan <END> metabolism by human hepatic CYP450 enzymes and transport by human P-glycoprotein.
\"Reaction phenotyping\" studies were performed with <START:DRUG> eletriptan <END> (ETT) to determine its propensity to interact with coadministered medications.
Its ability to serve as a substrate for human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was also investigated since a central mechanism of action has been proposed for this \"triptan\" class of drug.
DETT was selected to be monitored in our studies since it represents a significant ETT metabolite in humans, circulating at concentrations 10 to 20% of those observed for parent drug.
ETT was metabolized to DETT by recombinant CYP2D6 (rCYP2D6) and rCYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by rCYP2C9 and rCYP2C19.
ETT was determined to be a good substrate for human P-gp in vitro.
In bidirectional transport studies across LLC-MDR1 and LLC-Mdr1a cell monolayers, ETT had a BA/AB transport ratio in the range 9 to 11.
This finding had significance in vivo since brain exposure to ETT was reduced 40-fold in Mdr1a+/+ relative to Mdr1a-/- mice.
In studies with a characterized bank of human liver microsome preparations, a good correlation (r2 = 0.932) was obtained between formation of <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> eletriptan <END> (DETT) and CYP3A4-catalyzedtestosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation.
The metabolism of ETT to DETT in human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , and an inhibitory antibody to CYP3A4 ,but not by inhibitors of other major P450 enzymes.
ETT had little inhibitory effect on any of the P450 enzymes investigated.
"
ETT metabolism to DETT is therefore catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4, and plasma concentrations are expected to be increased when coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp activity.
 <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> induces CYP3A4 and multiple drug resistance protein 1 gene expression through activation of the pregnane X receptor.
In vitro and clinical studies were conducted to characterize the potential of <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> , an acyl-CoA/ <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> acyltransferase inhibitor to cause drug-drug interactions.
Clinically, 3- and 6-fold increases in <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> (CYP3A4 substrate ) oral clearance were observed after 50 and 750 mg of <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> daily for 7 days, respectively.
A 40%decrease in <START:DRUG> digoxin <END> (P-glycoprotein substrate ) area under the curve was observed with 750 mg of <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> daily for 10 days.
In vitro studies were conducted to define the mechanisms of these interactions.
Drug-drug interaction studies for CYP3A4 using pooled human hepatic microsomes and <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> at various concentrations, revealed IC50 values of 20.7 , 1.6 , and 3.1 microM using <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> , and <START:DRUG> felodipine <END> as probe substrates , respectively.
Our results indicate that <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> causes clinically significant drug-drug interactions through direct activation of hPXR and the subsequent induction of its target genes CYP3A4 and multiple drug resistance protein 1.
Induction was observed in CYP3A4 activity and immunoreactive protein ( EC50 of 200-400 nM ) in primary human hepatocytes treated with <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> treatment yielded similar results.
Microarray analysis revealed <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> (1 microM) increased CYP3A4 mRNA 20-fold, compared with a 23-fold increase with 50 microMrifampin.
 <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> induced P-glycoprotein mRNA by about 2-fold and immunoreactive protein in a dose-dependent manner.
Transient transfection assays showed that <START:DRUG> avasimibe <END> is a potent activator of the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) and more active than <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> on an equimolar basis.
Identification of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the N-oxidation of <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> is a triazole antifungal agent with potent activity against a broad spectrum of clinically significant pathogens.
In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> is extensively metabolized , with the major circulating metabolite resulting from N-oxidation.
In the present study, we report on the human cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the generation of this metabolite.
In human liver microsomes <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> N-oxidation exhibited biphasic kinetics with K(m1) of 8.1 microM , and K(m2) of 835 microM .
Incubations with recombinant enzymes suggested both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 as high-affinity enzymes ( K(m) values of 20 and 3.5 microM , respectively).
Further studies used chemical inhibitors in human liver microsomes prepared from individual donors, including two CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.
These data indicate that <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> is a substrate for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C9 involvement being minimal in human liver microsomes.
Genotype status for CYP2C19 and/or coadministration of drugs that modulate CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 activities could effect <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> plasma levels.
Studies at 2500 microMvoriconazole identified CYP3A4 as the low-affinity component, with activity correlating strongly with CYP3A4 activity in a bank of human liver microsomes (r = 0.90) and inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
At 25 microM, <START:DRUG> voriconazole <END> N-oxidation showed strong correlation with CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity (r = 0.77 and 0.74, respectively) and was inhibited by both <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
No inhibition was observed with <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , indicating a minor role for CYP2C9 in human liver , but inhibition by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was most potent in the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer livers, suggesting an increased role for CYP3A4 in individuals lacking CYP2C19.
Inhibition and activation of the human liver microsomal and human cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> by deployment-related chemicals.
Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are major catalysts involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates such as <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (TST).
Major TST metabolites formed by human liver microsomes include 6beta-hydroxytestosterone ( <START:DRUG> 6beta-OHTST <END> ), 2beta-hydroxytestosterone ( <START:DRUG> 2beta-OHTST <END> ) , and 15beta-hydroxytestosterone ( <START:DRUG> 15beta-OHTST <END> ) .
A screen of 16 cDNA-expressed human P450 isoforms demonstrated that 94% of all TST metabolites are produced by members of the CYP3A subfamily with <START:DRUG> 6beta-OHTST <END> accounting for 86% of all TST metabolites.
Similar K(m) values were observed for production of 6beta-, 2beta-, and <START:DRUG> 15beta-OHTST <END> with human liver microsomes (HLM) and CYP3A4.
However, V(max) and CL(int) were significantly higher for <START:DRUG> 6beta-OHTST <END> than <START:DRUG> 2beta-OHTST <END> (approximately 18-fold ) and <START:DRUG> 15beta-OHTST <END> (approximately 40-fold ).
Preincubation of HLM with a variety of ligands, including chemicals used in military deployments, resulted in varying levels of inhibition or activation of TST metabolism .
The greatest inhibition of TST metabolism in HLM was following preincubation with organophosphorus compounds, including <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , <START:DRUG> phorate <END> , and <START:DRUG> fonofos <END> , with up to 80% inhibition noticed for several metabolites including <START:DRUG> 6beta-OHTST <END> .
Preincubation of CYP3A4 with <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , but not <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> -oxon , resulted in 98% inhibition of TST metabolism .
 <START:DRUG> phorate <END> and <START:DRUG> fonofos <END> also inhibited the production of most primary metabolites of CYP3A4.
Kinetic analysis indicated that <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> was one of the most potent inhibitors of major TST metabolites followed by <START:DRUG> fonofos <END> and <START:DRUG> phorate <END> .
 <START:DRUG> chlorpyrifos <END> , <START:DRUG> fonofos <END> , and <START:DRUG> phorate <END> inhibited major TST metabolites noncompetitively and irreversibly.
Conversely, preincubation of CYP3A4 with <START:DRUG> pyridostigmine <END> bromide increased metabolite levels of <START:DRUG> 6beta-OHTST <END> and <START:DRUG> 2beta-OHTST <END> .
Preincubation of human aromatase (CYP19) with the test chemicals had no effect on the production of the endogenous <START:DRUG> estrogen <END> , 17beta- <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> .
Oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> in the human liver.
Effect of the CYP3A maturation.
 <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> is a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor intended to be used to treat HIV-infected children.
Although a pediatric dosage is proposed by the manufacturer, no data are currently available on the pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> in neonates and infants.
 <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> being primarily eliminated after oxidative biotransformation, we explored its in vitro metabolism by cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent monooxygenases.
In our conditions, five metabolites were formed in vitro and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; P450-dependent oxidations occurred either on the tetrahydrofuran ring (M3 and M4), the aniline ring (M5), and the aliphatic chain (M2) or resulted from the N-dealkylation and loss of the tetrahydrofuran ring (M1).
The two major metabolites, respectively M3 and M2 were formed by human liver microsomes with K(m) between 10 and 70 microM .
CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP3A5 were major contributors for the formation of M2, M3, and M5 metabolites,whereas CYP3A7 had no or little activity.
"
The metabolism of <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> was negligible in microsomes from either fetuses or neonates and steadily increased after the first weeks of life in relation with the maturation of CYP3A4/5.
In conclusion, results demonstrated that the capacity of the human liver to oxidize <START:DRUG> amprenavir <END> is low during the first weeks after birth and that dosage could be substantially reduced during the early neonatal period.
This assumption was confirmed by inhibition with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> (two potent inhibitors of CYP3A) whereas <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (2C9 inhibitor ) and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (2D6 inhibitor ) were inefficient.
Effects of <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> , a new antiallergic agent, on human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 activities.
 <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> , a new histamine H(1) receptor-selective antagonist, is a tricyclic drug containing an alkylamino moiety.
Some compounds containing a similar alkylamino group form a cytochrome p450 (p450) -iron (II)-nitrosoalkane metabolite complex [metabolic intermediate complex (MIC)], thereby causing quasi-irreversible inhibition of the p450.
There was concern that <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> might also form MICs, therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to explore this possibility.
We identified the enzymes catalyzing <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> metabolism and investigated the effect of <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> on human p450 activities.
During incubation with human liver microsomes in the presence of a NADPH-generating system, <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> was metabolized to two metabolites, M1 (N-monodemethylolopatadine) and M3 ( <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> N-oxide) at rates of 0.330 and 2.50 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively.
High specific activity of M3 formation was exhibited by cDNA-expressed flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO)1 and FMO3.
 <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> did not inhibit p450 activities when it was simultaneously incubated with substrates for different p450 isozymes.
Also, p450 activities in human liver microsomes were unaffected by pretreatment with <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> or M1.
Furthermore, spectral analysis revealed that neither <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> nor M1 formed an MIC.
Therefore, it is unlikely that <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> will cause drug-drug interactions involving p450 isozymes.
 <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , which are both selective inhibitors of CYP3A, significantly reduced M1 formation but specific inhibitors of other p450 isozymes did not decrease M1 formation.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> olopatadine <END> with cDNA-expressed human p450 isozymes confirmed that M1 formation was almost exclusively catalyzed by CYP3A4.
The formation of M3 was enhanced by N-octylamine and was inhibited by <START:DRUG> thiourea <END> .
Pathways of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> bioactivation in vitro I. Characterization of human cytochromes P450 responsible for the formation of 2- and 3-hydroxylated metabolites.
In vitro studies were conducted to identify the cytochromes P450 (P450s) involved in the formation of 2- and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> , metabolites that may serve as precursors in the formation of protein-reactive metabolites.
Human liver microsomes (HLMs) converted <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> (30-300 microM) to <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> at rates >25 times those of <START:DRUG> 2-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> .
Both the 2- and 3-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> appeared to conform to monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics in HLMs (apparent K(m) values, approximately 1640 and approximately 217 microM ; apparent V(max) values, approximately 5.71 and approximately 46.9 pmol/mg of protein/min, respectively).
Formation of 2- and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> did not correlate significantly with any other P450 activities.
These results suggest that CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are largely responsible for the formation of 3-hyrdoxycarbamazepine, whereas multiple P450s (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2E1, and 3A4) contributed to <START:DRUG> 2-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> formation.
Rates of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> 2- and 3-hydroxylation correlated strongly with CYP2B6 activity (r >or= 0.757) in a panel of HLMs (n = 8).
Carbamazepine3-hydroxylation also correlatedsignificantly with CYP2C8 activity at a <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> concentration of 30 microM.
The chemical inhibitors <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (CYP3A) and <START:DRUG> 7-EFC <END> (CYP2B6) inhibited both 2- and <START:DRUG> 3-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> formation whereas <START:DRUG> 4-methylpyrazole <END> (CYP2E1) markedly decreased <START:DRUG> 2-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> formation .
Several recombinant P450s catalyzedcarbamazepine 2- and 3-hydroxylation, but after adjustment for relative hepatic abundance, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 appeared to be the major catalysts of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> 3-hydroxylase activity, and at least five P450s were significant contributors to <START:DRUG> 2-hydroxycarbamazepine <END> formation; CYP2E1 made the greatest contribution to the Cl(int) of <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> 2-hydroxylation (approximately 30%), but P450s CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, and 3A4 also made significant contributions (approximately 13-18%).
Inhibition of cytochrome P450 2E1 by <START:DRUG> propofol <END> in human and porcine liver microsomes.
While almost anesthetics are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, some major volatile ones such as <START:DRUG> halothane <END> and <START:DRUG> sevoflurane <END> are metabolized by CYP2E1 in humans.
Basal human enzyme activities were characterized by a V(max) of 1426+/-230 and 288+/-29 pmol min(-1)mg(-1) protein and a K(m) of 122+/-47 and 149+/-42 microM , while the corresponding porcine activities were associated with a V(max) of 352+/-42 pmol min(-1)mg(-1) protein and a K(m) of 167+/-38 microM .
These in vitro results suggest that <START:DRUG> propofol <END> could have a protective effect on toxic metabolite activation of compounds catalyzed by CYP2E1.
To determine whether <START:DRUG> 2,6-diisopropylphenol <END> ( <START:DRUG> propofol <END> ), a widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, known to inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, also inhibits CYP2E1, 6-OH hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , a prototypical CYP2E1 substrate, was estimated using two pools of human microsomes and one pool of porcine microsomes from seven livers.
A competitive inhibition of CYP2E1 by <START:DRUG> propofol <END> was observed with low inhibition constants in the therapeutic range in both porcine (19 microM) and human (48 microM) liver microsomes.
Inhibitory effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) on human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro: mechanism of drug interaction between TCAs and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> .
The ability of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) to inhibit <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> p-hydroxylation was evaluated in vitro by incubation studies of human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed cytochrome p450s (p450s).
The TCAs tested were <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> , <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , <START:DRUG> nortriptyline <END> , and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> .
None of the TCAs tested produced remarkable inhibition of any other p450 isoforms.
 <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> strongly and competitively inhibited <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> p-hydroxylation in microsomal incubations (estimated K(i) values of 5.2 and 15.5 micro M, respectively).
In contrast, <START:DRUG> nortriptyline <END> and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> produced only weak inhibition.
In the incubation study using cDNA-expressed P450s, both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19catalyzedphenytoin p-hydroxylation, whereas TCAs inhibited only the CYP2C19 pathway.
All of the TCAs tested inhibitedCYP2D6-catalyzeddextromethorphan-O-demethylation competitively, with estimated K(i) values of 31.0 , 28.6 , 7.9 , and 12.5 micro M , respectively.
The tertiary amine TCAs, <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> , also inhibited CYP2C19-catalyzed S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'- hydroxylation (estimated K(i) of 37.7 and 56.8 micro M , respectively).
The secondary amine TCAs, <START:DRUG> nortriptyline <END> and <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> , however, showed minimal inhibition of CYP2C19 (estimated IC(50) of 600 and 685 micro M , respectively).
These results suggest that TCAs inhibit both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and that the interaction between TCAs and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> involves inhibition of CYP2C19-catalyzedphenytoin p-hydroxylation.
The interactions of a selective protein kinase C beta inhibitor with the human cytochromes P450.
Studies were performed to determine the cytochromes P450 (P450) responsible for the biotransformation of (S)-13 [(dimethylamino)methyl]-10,11,14,15-tetrahydro-4,9:16,21-dimetheno-1H , 13H-dibenzo [e,k]pyrrolo [3,4-h] [1,4,13]oxadiazacyclohexadecene-1,3(2H)-dione ( <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> ) to its equipotent metabolite, <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> , and to examine the ability of these two compounds to inhibit P450-mediated metabolism.
Kinetic studies indicated that a single enzyme in human liver microsomes was able to form <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> with an apparent K(M) value of approximately 1 microM.
The formation rate of <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> was correlated with markers of nine P450s in a bank of 20 human liver microsomes.
The only significantcorrelation observed was with the form-selective activity for CYP3A.
Of the nine cDNA-expressed P450s examined, only CYP3A4 and CYP2D6formedN-desmethyl <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> .
However, CYP3A4formed <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> at a rate 57-fold greater than that observed with CYP2D6.
Thus, CYP3A is responsible for the formation of <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> .
Less potent inhibition by these compounds of metabolism mediated by the other three P450s examined was observed.
In conclusion, CYP3A is primarily responsible for forming <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> .
Therefore, alterations in the activity of this enzyme have the potential to affect <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> clearance .
In addition, <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> and its metabolite are predicted to be potential inhibitors of CYP2D6-mediated reactions in vivo.
In incubations with human liver microsomes, <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , an inhibitor of CYP2D6, demonstrated little inhibition of metabolite formation while <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , an inhibitor of CYP3A, demonstrated almost complete inhibition.
 <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> and <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> were also examined for their ability to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and CYP1A2.
 <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> and <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> <START:DRUG> lY333531 <END> were found to competitively inhibit CYP2D6 with calculated K(i) values of 0.17 and 1.0 microM , respectively.
Cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated bioactivation of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> : irreversible enzyme inhibition and thiol adduct formation.
 <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> is a selective <START:DRUG> estrogen <END> receptor modulator which is effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
The nature of the inhibition was irreversible and was NADPH- and preincubation time-dependent, with K(I) and k(inact) values estimated at 9.9 microM and 0.16 min(-1) , respectively.
Subsequently, GSH adducts of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> were identified in incubations with human liver microsomes; substitution with GSH occurred at the 5- or 7-position of the benzothiophene moiety or at the 3'-position of the <START:DRUG> phenol <END> ring, with the 7-glutathionyl derivative being most abundant based on LC/MS and NMR analyses.
These adducts are postulated to derive from addition of GSH to <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> arene oxides followed by dehydration and aromatization.
Alternatively, raloxifenemay be oxidized to an extended <START:DRUG> quinone <END> intermediate, which then is trapped by GSH conjugation.
The GSH adducts also were detected in incubations of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> with rat or human hepatocytes, while the corresponding N- <START:DRUG> acetylcysteine <END> adducts were identified in the bile and urine from rats treated orally with the drug at 5 mg/kg.
Taken together, these data indicate that P450 3A4-mediated bioactivation of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> in vitro is accompanied by loss of enzyme activity.
The significance of these findings with respect to the clinical use of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> remains to be determined.
We report herein that cytochrome P450 (P450)3A4 is inhibited by <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> in human liver microsomal incubations.
The observed loss of P450 3A4 activity was attenuated partially by <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> (GSH) , implying the involvement of a reactive metabolite(s) in the inactivation process.
The bioactivation of <START:DRUG> raloxifene <END> most likely is catalyzed by P450 3A4, since the formation of GSH adducts was almost abolished when liver microsomes were pretreated with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> or with an inhibitory anti-P450 3A4 IgG.
CYP3A4induction by drugs: correlation between a pregnane X receptor reporter gene assay and CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes.
Induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is determined typically by employing primary culture of human hepatocytes and measuring CYP3A4 mRNA, protein and microsomal activity.
Recently a pregnane X receptor (PXR) reporter gene assay was established to screen CYP3A4 inducers .
To evaluate results from the PXR reporter gene assay with those from the aforementioned conventional assays, 14 drugs were evaluated for their ability to induce CYP3A4 and activate PXR.
Sandwiched primary cultures of human hepatocytes from six donors were used and CYP3A4 activity was assessed by measuring microsomal <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity.
Hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA and protein levels were also analyzed using branched DNA technology/Northern blotting and Western blotting, respectively.
In general, PXR activationcorrelated with the induction potential observed in human hepatocyte cultures.
It is concluded that the PXR reporter gene assay is a reliable and complementary method to assess the CYP3A4induction potential of drugs and other xenobiotics.
 <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , and <START:DRUG> sulfinpyrazone <END> highly activated PXR and increased CYP3A4 activity; <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> , <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> , <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> -t-butylacetate, <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfadimidine <END> , and <START:DRUG> taxol <END> weakly activated PXR and induced CYP3A4 activity, and <START:DRUG> methotrexate <END> and <START:DRUG> probenecid <END> showed no marked activation in either system .
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> showed marked PXR activation but no increase (in the case of <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> ) or a significant decrease (in the case of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> ) in microsomal CYP3A4 activity.
 <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> metabolism by the CYP2C subfamily.
This research investigated the biotransformation of <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> by cytochrome P-450 (CYP).
We used liver microsomes from humans and/or animals and the recombinant specific CYP isozymes to investigate CYP-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> .
 <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> was biotransformed into 5-hydroxythalidomide ( <START:DRUG> 5-OH <END> ) and diastereomeric 5'-hydroxythalidomide (5'-OH) by liver microsomes.
The human liver microsomes with higher CYP2C19 activity formed more metabolites than those with lower CYP2C19 activity and had less activity in metabolite formations than those from rats.
Recombinant human CYP2C19 and rat CYP2C6 isozymes were primarily responsible for forming these metabolites, and the male rat-specific CYP2C11formed only 5'-OH .
 <START:DRUG> 5-OH <END> was subsequently hydroxylated to <START:DRUG> 5,6-dihydroxythalidomide <END> by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP1A1 in humans and by CYP2C11, CYP1A1, CYP2C6, and CYP2C12 in rats.
The contribution of the CYP2C subfamily was supported by the immunoinhibition study using human liver microsomes.
We discovered that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19 is responsible for 5- and 5'-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> in humans.
In rats, <START:DRUG> thalidomide <END> was hydroxylated extensively by CYP2C6 as well as the sex-specific enzyme CYP2C11.
Incubations with S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , substrates of CYP2C19, inhibited metabolism by human liver microsomes, supporting the involvement of CYP2C19.
 <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , an inhibitor of CYP1A , simultaneously stimulated the <START:DRUG> 5-OH <END> formation and inhibited <START:DRUG> cis-5'-OH <END> formation catalyzed by human liver microsomes.
When we used the microsomes from treated rats, the metabolite formations did not increase by inducers for CYP1A , CYP2B , CYP2E , CYP3A, or CYP4A, suggesting that these could not be involved in the main metabolic pathway in rats.
 <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> are selective inhibitors of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, respectively.
To evaluate the inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> on cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms, selective marker reactions for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 were examined in human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.
The in vivo drug interactions of <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> were predicted in vitro using [I]/( [I] + K(i)) values.
With concentrations higher than 100 microMtrimethoprim and 500 microMsulfamethoxazole, both drugs lost their selectivity for the P450 isoforms.
With concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 microM, <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> exhibited a selective inhibitory effect on CYP2C8-mediated <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2C8, with apparent IC(50) (K(i)) values of 54 microM (32 microM) and 75 microM , respectively.
With concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 microM, <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> was a selective inhibitor of CYP2C9-mediated <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation in human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2C9, with apparent IC(50) (K(i)) values of 544 microM (271 microM) and 456 microM , respectively.
Based on estimated total hepatic concentrations (or free plasma concentrations) of the drugs and the scaling model, one would expect in vivo in humans 80% (26%) and 13% (24%)inhibition of the metabolic clearance of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates by <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> , respectively.
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and <START:DRUG> sulfamethoxazole <END> can be used as selective inhibitors of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in in vitro studies.
In humans, <START:DRUG> trimethoprim <END> and sulfamethoxazolemay inhibit the activities of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, respectively.
Induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 in primary human hepatocytes and activation of the human pregnane X receptor by <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> .
 <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> is a widely utilized antiestrogen in the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer.
Clinical studies document that <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> administration markedly enhances the systemic elimination of other drugs.
Additionally, <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> enhances its own clearance following repeated dosing.
The mechanisms that underlie these clinically important events remain unresolved.
Maximal induction was achieved at the 5 microM level.
We also observed corresponding increase in the CYP3A4 immunoreactive protein and mRNA levels.
The efficacy of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> relative to <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> for hPXR activation was approximately 30 and 60%, respectively.
Furthermore, the CYP3A4inductionmay be a result of hPXR activation.
These findings have important implications for optimizing the use of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and in the development of newer antiestrogens.
Here, we report that <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and its metabolite <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> markedly induce cytochrome P450 3A4, a drug-metabolizing enzyme of central importance, in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
 <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> (1-10 microM) significantlyincreased the CYP3A4 expression and activity (measured as the rate of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation).
At this level, <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> caused a 1.5- to 3.3-fold (mean, 2.1-fold) and 3.4- to 17-fold (mean, 7.5-fold)increase in the CYP3A4 activity, respectively.
In comparison, <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> treatment resulted in a 6- to 16-fold (mean, 10.5-fold)increase.
Furthermore, <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> and <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxytamoxifen <END> efficaciously activated the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR; also known as the steroid xenobiotic receptor), a key regulator of CYP3A4 expression.
Our results indicate that the mechanism of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> -mediated alteration in drug clearance pathways in humans may involve CYP3A4induction by the parent drug and/or its metabolite.
Inhibitory effects of H1-antihistamines on CYP2D6- and CYP2C9-mediated drug metabolic reactions in human liver microsomes.
To screen the inhibitory effects of H1-antihistamines on hepatic <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation and on <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation were used as index reactions for CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, respectively.
The metabolites of both reactions were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography and were used as indicators of whether CYP2D6 or CYP2C9 activities were inhibited or unaffected by the agents.
Further studies in humans, especially in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, will be required to confirm these findings.
All five H1-antihistamines studied showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 32-109 microM .
 <START:DRUG> cyclizine <END> and <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> showed inhibitory effects on <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-methylhydroxylation with IC20 values of 85 microM and 88 microM , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> tripelennamine <END> , <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> , and <START:DRUG> diphenhydramine <END> showed no inhibitory effects on CYP2C9.
All five H1-antihistamines studied inhibited CYP2D6markedly, but only <START:DRUG> cyclizine <END> and <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> inhibited CYP2C9 at concentrations above that usually seen in plasma.
 <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> and <START:DRUG> chlorpheniramine <END> inhibited CYP2D6 at concentrations that are very close to their therapeutic plasma concentrations.
Effects of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae radix on cytochrome P-450 activities in human liver microsomes.
A series of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae radix were evaluated for their effects on cytochrome P-450 (CYP) activities in human liver microsomes.
Kinetic analysis revealed that the mechanism of inhibition varied according to the flavonoids.
These results suggest that flavonoids tested are inhibitors of hepatic CYP1A2 and that the extracts of Scutellariae radix, widely used as a hepatoprotective agent, may protect the liver through the prevention of CYPIA2-induced metabolic activation of protoxicants.
All flavonoids did not substantially inhibit pentoxyresorufin O-deethylation (CYP2B 1), <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6), and <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1) activities (IC50: >50 microM).
Baicalein and 2',5,6',7-tetrahydroxyflavone inhibited hepatic <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) activity with a IC50 of 17.4 and 7.8 microM, respectively.
Oroxylin A inhibiteddiclofenac 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C9) activity with a IC50 of 6.7 microM.
In contrast, all flavonoids tested inhibited hepatic <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N'-demethylation (CYP1A2) with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 51.3 microM.
Human cytochrome P450s involved in the metabolism of 9-cis- and <START:DRUG> 13-cis-retinoic acids <END> .
The purpose of this work was to identify the principal human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in the metabolism of the retinoic acid (RA) isomers, 9-cis- and <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> , by using a combination of techniques including human liver microsomes (correlation of activity and inhibition), and lymphoblast microsomes expressing a single CYP.
Concerning the <START:DRUG> 9-cis-RA <END> , 4-OH- and 4-oxo- <START:DRUG> 9-cis-RA <END> were formed with human liver microsomes, and their formation correlated with activities linked to CYPs 3A4/5 , 2B6, 2C8, 2A6, and 2C9.
The use of lymphoblast microsomes expressing a single human CYP identified CYPs 2C9>2C8>3A7 as the most active in the formation of 4-OH- <START:DRUG> 9-cis-RA <END> .
With regard to <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> , specific P450 activities linked to CYPs 2B6, 2C8, 3A4/5 , and 2A6 were correlated with the formation of 4-OH- and 4-oxo- <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> .
Microsomes expressing a single CYP identified CYPs 3A7, 2C8, 4A11, 1B1, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 (decreasing activity) in the formation of 4-OH- <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> .
In conclusion, adult human CYPs 2C9, 2C8, 3A4 have been identified as active in the <START:DRUG> 9-cis-RA <END> metabolism , whereas CYPs 3A4 and 2C8 were active in <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> metabolism .
The fetal form CYP3A7 was also identified as very active in either 9-cis- or <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> metabolism .
The role of these human CYPs in the biological response or resistance to RA isomers remains to be determined.
The use of CYP-specific inhibitors in human liver microsomes disclosed that the formation of the 4-OH- <START:DRUG> 9-cis-RA <END> was best inhibited by <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (72%) and <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> (66%), whereas <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> inhibited its formation by 55 and 38%, respectively; the formation of 4-OH- <START:DRUG> 13-cis-RA <END> was best inhibited by <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (54%) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (46%), whereas <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> was a weak inhibitor (14%).
Inhibition of cytochromes P450 by antifungal <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> derivatives.
The interactions of a panel of antifungal agents with cytochromes P450 (P450s) , as a means of predicting potential drug-drug interactions, have not yet been investigated.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of five antifungal agents using selective probe reactions for each of the eight major P450s .
The index reactions used were <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (for CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6), <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 5-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6), 7-ethoxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> deethylation (CYP2B6), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfonation (CYP3A4).
Five antifungal agents that include an <START:DRUG> imidazole <END> moiety ( <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> tioconazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) were examined in cDNA-expressing microsomes from human lymphoblast cells or human liver microsomes.
All inhibitors studied demonstrated nonselective inhibition of P450s.
Therefore, this class of compounds is likely to result in significant drug-drug interactions in vivo.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> seemed to be the most selective for CYP3A4, although it also inhibited CYP2C9.
High-affinity inhibition was seen for CYP1A2 ( <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> tioconazole <END> K(i) , 0.4 microM ), CYP2B6 ( <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> K(i), 0.05 microM ; <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> K(i), 0.04 microM ), CYP2C19 ( <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> K(i) , 0.05 microM ; <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> K(i) , 0.008 microM ; <START:DRUG> tioconazole <END> K(i) , 0.04 microM ), CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> K(i) , 0.01 microM), CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> K(i) , 0.70 microM ; <START:DRUG> sulconazole <END> K(i) , 0.40 microM ), CYP2E1 ( <START:DRUG> tioconazole <END> K(i) , 0.4 microM), and CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> K(i) , 0.02 microM ; <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> K(i) , 0.03 microM; <START:DRUG> tioconazole <END> K(i) , 0.02 microM).
Role of cytochrome P450 in <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolism in vitro.
Catechol <START:DRUG> estrogens <END> and <START:DRUG> 16alpha-hydroxy <END> <START:DRUG> estrogen <END> are important metabolites that cause carcinogenesis.
This study was aimed to study the role of cytochrome P450 in <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolism .
The <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolites were determined with HPLC-ECD.
Correlation of <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolites production between cytochrome P450 activity, the inhibitory effect of specific inhibitors and enzyme catalyzing kinetics were studied in cDNA-expressed P450 or human liver microsomes.
This result suggests that in human liver microsomes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 play an important role in 2-hydroxy <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> formation.
At low substrate concentration, 17beta -hydroxy dehydrogenation dominated the <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> metabolism , but at high substrate concentration, 2-hydroxylation exceeded 17beta-hydroxy dehydrogenation to become the important mechanism.
CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 catalyze the <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> 2-hydroxylation.
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 have high activity in catalyzing 17beta-hydroxy dehydrogenation in cDNA expressed P450, but CYP1A2 is the most important enzyme in catalyzing <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> 2-hydroxylation.
Using <START:DRUG> furafyllin <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in liver microsomes, it was found that the 2-hydroxylation had been inhibited about the same amount.
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are two important enzymes catalyzing the main <START:DRUG> estradiol <END> 2-hydroxylation metabolism pathway at high substrate concentrations.
17beta-hydroxy dehydrogenation is the main metabolism pathway at low concentrations, and CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8may have high catalyzing activity.
Comparative studies to determine the selective inhibitors for P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P4503A4 .
It has been suggested that cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and MDR1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) act synergistically to limit the bioavailability of orally administered agents.
In order to determine the relative role of these proteins, it is essential to identify a selective inhibitor for either P-gp or CYP3A4.
In the present investigation, comparative studies were performed to examine the effect of inhibitors on the function of these proteins.
The IC50 of P-gp function, determined by examining the inhibition of the transcellular transport of <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> across Caco-2 monolayers, was in the order PSC833 < <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> < N-(2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl)-5-(2(S)-(1,1-dimethylethylaminocarbonyl)-4-(furo(2,3-b)pyridin-5-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)-4(S)-hydroxy-2(R)-phenylmethylpentanamide ( <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> ).
In contrast, the IC50 of CYP3A4 function, determined by examining the inhibition of the metabolism of <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> by intestinal and liver microsomes, was in the order L-754,384 < <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> < PSC 833 and <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
The ratio of IC50 for P-gp to that for CYP3A4 was more than 200 for <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> , 60 ~ 150 for <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , 1.5 for <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> , and 0.05 for PSC 833.
Collectively, it was demonstrated that PSC 833 and <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> can be used as selective inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4, respectively.
In vitro evaluation of <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> as an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 isoforms: preferential inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9).
To evaluate the potency and specificity of <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> as an inhibitor of the activity of different human CYP isoforms in liver microsomes.
Using pooled human liver microsomes, the effects of <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> on seven CYP isoform specific marker reactions were measured: <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylase (CYP2A6), <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylase (CYP2C9), S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19), <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylase (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylase (CYP2E1) and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A4).
However, minimal inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 activities was observed.
Inhibition of CYP2C9 can explain some of the effects of <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs, such as <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> .
Co-administration of high doses of <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP2C9may result in significant drug interactions.
 <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> competitively inhibited CYP2C9 activity with a Ki value of 600 microM.
In addition, <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> slightly inhibited CYP2C19 activity (Ki = 8553 microM, mixed inhibition) and CYP3A4 activity ( Ki = 7975 microM, competitive inhibition).
The inhibition of CYP2A6 activity by <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> was time-, concentration- and NADPH-dependent ( KI = 9150 microM, Kinact =0.048 min(-1)), consistent with mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2A6.
 <START:DRUG> valproic acid <END> inhibits the activity of CYP2C9 at clinically relevant concentrations in human liver microsomes.
Characterization of the selectivity and mechanism of cytochrome P450 inhibition by dimethyl-4,4'-dimethoxy-5,6,5',6'-dimethylenedioxybiphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and cytochrome P450 (P450) prototype substrates were performed to characterize the selectivity and mechanism of inhibition of P450 by dimethyl-4,4'-dimethoxy-5,6,5',6'-dimethylenedioxybiphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylate ( <START:DRUG> DDB <END> ).
Spectral analysis indicated that the formation of metabolite-P450 complex having absorbance at 456 nm was concentration-dependent; 5 to 33% of the total P450 was complexed in rat and human liver microsomes after a 5-min incubation with <START:DRUG> DDB <END> .
In addition, microsomal incubations with <START:DRUG> DDB <END> in the presence of NADPH resulted in a loss of spectral P450 content, which was restored after adding K(3)Fe(CN)(6).
This complex formation resulted in a time-dependent loss of CYP3A-catalyzed marker activity ( <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation) in human liver microsomes.
The inhibition was only partially restored upon dialysis.
These results collectively suggest that formation of a metabolite-CYP3A complex with <START:DRUG> DDB <END> was responsible for the CYP3A-selective time-dependent loss of catalytic function of CYP3A.
 <START:DRUG> DDB <END> was found to be a strong inhibitor of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation activity (CYP3A4) with a K(i) value of 0.27 +/- 0.21 microM.
At higher concentrations, <START:DRUG> DDB <END> marginally inhibitedcaffeine N(3)-demethylation (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), and <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6) activities, but this compound had no effect on CYP2A6-, CYP2C19-, and CYP2E1-mediated reactions.
 <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> is activated by CYP2C19 in human liver.
Phosphorothioate compounds are used throughout the world as agricultural and domestic pesticides.
Here, the activation of the phosphorothioate <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> to diazoxon in human liver is described.
In an initial study using three human liver microsomal samples, K(m) for diazoxon formation varied markedly (31, 208, and 660 microM; V(max)1125, 685, and 1028 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively), suggesting the involvement of more than one P450 enzyme.
A wide variation in activity was found using 50 microMdiazinon as substrate, (11-648 pmol/min/mg protein, n = 15), whereas, with 500 microM, variation was less (164-978 pmol/min/mg protein).
The putative low-affinity component (500 microMdiazinon) correlated with both S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase (r = 0.714; p < 0.005) and high-affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity (r = 0.625; p < 0.05).
These data suggest contributions from CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4.
None of the inhibitors affected the high-affinity component.
These data indicate that CYP2C19 is the major enzyme involved in <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> activation in human liver, while other enzymes including CYP1A2may play a more minor role.
Among eight P450-catalyzed reactions, the putative high-affinity component (50 microM <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> ) correlated with S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.686, p < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of CYP2C19.
This activity was partially inhibited by <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> .
Of seven heterologously expressed human P450 enzymes, CYP2C19activated <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> (500 microM) at the fastest rate, followed by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9.
Both hepatic microsomal S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase and high-affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activities were strongly inhibited by <START:DRUG> diazinon <END> (IC50< 2.5 microM), while no effect was seen on <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylase activity.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> is a potent inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 2C9.
The in vitro inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 ( <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation), CYP2A6 ( <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation), CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation), CYP2C19 (S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation), CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-deethylation), CYP2E1 ( <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation), and CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation) activities were examined using pooled human liver microsomes.
The in vivo drug interactions of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> were predicted in vitro using the [I]/( [I] + K(i) ) values.
Based on [I]/( [I] + K(i) ) values calculated using peak total (or unbound) plasma concentration of <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> , 96% (56%), 86% (24%), and 64% (8%)inhibition of the clearance of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 substrates could be expected, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> strongly and competitively inhibited CYP2C9 activity, with a K(i) ( IC(50) ) value of 5.8 (9.6) microM.
In addition, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> exhibited somewhat smaller inhibitory effects on CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 activities, with K(i) (IC(50)) values of 24 (47) microM and 82 (136) microM, respectively.
With concentrations up to 250 microM, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> showed no appreciable effect on CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 activities.
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> inhibits the activity of CYP2C9 at clinically relevant concentrations, and this is the likely mechanism by which <START:DRUG> gemfibrozil <END> interacts with CYP2C9 substrate drugs, such as <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> and <START:DRUG> glyburide <END> .
Gemfibrozilmay also impair clearance of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 substrates, but inhibition of other CYP isoforms is unlikely.
In vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> in human liver and intestine: assessment of drug interactions.
 <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> is a selective 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist with promotile activity in the gastrointestinal tract.
This study was designed to describe the metabolic pathways of <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> in the human liver and small intestine in vitro, to identify the enzymes involved in <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> metabolism, and to investigate the effect of <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> on CYP-catalyzed reactions involving other compounds.
 <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> was metabolized in human liver microsomes to O-desmethyl <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> at a low rate.
In human liver slices, direct N-glucuronidation of <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> at the <START:DRUG> guanidine <END> nitrogens (M43.2, M43.8, and M45.3) was found, with M43.8 being the major metabolite.
Human small intestine slices also metabolized <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> to the N-glucuronides, suggesting a contribution of the small intestine to the presystemic metabolism.
5-Methoxyindole-3-carboxylic acid (M29.0), the main metabolite in human plasma, was generated in vitro by a sequence of reactions starting with nonenzymatic acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, followed by enzymatic oxidation and conjugation with glucuronic acid.
However, these K(i) values are approximately 140-foldgreater than the maximal <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> plasma concentrations following the clinically relevant 6-mg oral dose given to healthy volunteers.
M29.0, the main circulating metabolite, did not demonstrate any inhibitory potential toward cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro.
Therefore, clinically relevant metabolic drug interactions with <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> seem unlikely.
This metabolite was also formed by cDNA expressed CYP2D6, and the reaction in human liver microsomes was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A only to a small extent with IC(50) values >30 microM.
 <START:DRUG> tegaserod <END> more effectively inhibited CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 with K(i) values of 0.84 and 0.85 microM, respectively.
Different enantioselective 9-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> by the two human CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.
The antipsychotic agent <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , is metabolized by different cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP2D6, to the active 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which is the major metabolite in plasma.
Two enantiomers, (+)- and (-)-9-hydroxyrisperidone might be formed, and the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/CYP3A5 in the formation of these two enantiomers in human liver microsomes and in recombinantly expressed enzymes.
The enantiomers of 9-hydroxyrisperidone were analyzed with high pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral alpha-1 acid glycoprotein column.
A much higher formation rate was observed for (+)-9-hydroxyrisperidone than for (-)-9-hydroxyrisperidone in microsomes prepared from six individual livers.
Recombinant human CYP2D6produced only (+)-9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas a lower formation rate of both enantiomers was detected with expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
In vivo data from 18 patients during treatment with <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> indicate that the plasma concentration of the (+)-enantiomer is higher than that of the (-)-enantiomer in extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.
These findings clearly suggest that CYP2D6 plays a predominant role in (+)-9-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> risperidone <END> , the major metabolic pathway in clinical conditions, whereas CYP3A catalyzes the formation of the (-)-9-hydroxymetabolite.
Further studies are required to evaluate the pharmacological/toxic activity of both enantiomers.
The formation of (+)-9-hydroxyrisperidone was strongly inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, whereas <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a CYP3A4 inhibitor, strongly inhibited the formation of (-)-9-hydroxyrisperidone.
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> vanoxerine <END> , 1- [2- [bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl) <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> , by human cytochrome P450 enzymes.
 <START:DRUG> vanoxerine <END> (1- [2- [bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl) <START:DRUG> piperazine <END> ; <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> ) is a promising agent for the treatment of <START:DRUG> cocaine <END> dependence.
Knowledge of the major pathway for GBR12909metabolism is important for prediction of the likelihood of drug-drug interactions, which may affect the therapeutic clinical outcome, when this agent is used in <START:DRUG> cocaine <END> -dependent individuals receiving multiple drug therapy.
We studied biotransformation of <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> in human liver microsomes (n = 4), human hepatocytes, and microsomes containing cDNA-expressed human P450 isoforms with <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> concentrations within the range of steady-state plasma concentrations detected in healthy volunteers.
A high-pressure liquid chromatography assay was used to measure parent <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> and its primary metabolite.
 <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> was metabolized by human liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and cDNA-expressed human P450s to a single metabolite.
cDNA-expressed P450 3A4 metabolized <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> to a greater extent than 2C8 and 2E1.
These data suggest the possibility that multiple P450 isoforms may be involved in human <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> metabolism but that CYP3A appears to be the major enzyme responsible for human <START:DRUG> gBR12909 <END> biotransformation.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a selective inhibitor of CYP3A, reducedGBR12909biotransformation in human liver microsomes and primary hepatocytes by 92 +/- 2 and 92.4 +/- 0.4%, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> quercetin <END> (an inhibitor of CYP2C8/3A4) was a less effective inhibitor producing 62 +/- 22% inhibition in human liver microsomes and 54 +/- 35% in hepatocytes.
Other P450 selective inhibitors did notdecreaseGBR12909biotransformation more than 29% in either human liver microsomes or hepatocytes with the exception of <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CYP2E1), which inhibitedGBR12909 biotransformation by 71.4 +/- 18.5% in primary human hepatocytes.
 <START:DRUG> ciprofloxacin <END> (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19) did not demonstrate statistically significant inhibition(p > 0.05) of GBR12909biotransformation in liver microsomes.
Metabolism of 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-7-benzyloxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> by human hepatic CYP isoforms: evidence for selectivity towards CYP3A4.
1.
The metabolism of 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-7-benzyloxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> (BFBFC) to 7-hydroxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> (HFC) was studied in human liver microsomes and in cDNA-expressed human liver CYP isoforms.
For purposes of comparison, some limited studies were also performed with <START:DRUG> 7-benzyloxyquinoline <END> ( <START:DRUG> 7BQ <END> ).
2.
Initial interactive docking studies with a homology model of human CYP3A4 indicated that BFBFC was likely to be a selective substrate for CYP3A4 with a relatively high binding affinity, due to the presence of several key hydrogen bonds with active site amino acid residues.
3.
Kinetic analysis of NADPH-dependent BFBFC metabolism to HFC in three preparations of pooled human liver microsomes revealed mean (+/- TSEM) Km and Vmax = 4.6 +/- 0.3 microM and 20.0 +/- 3.8 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively.
4.
The metabolism of BFBFC to HFC was determined in a characterized bank of 24 individual human liver microsomal preparations employing a BFBFC substrate concentration of lO microM (i.e. around twice Km).
5.
While 10O microMBFBFC was metabolized to HFC by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4, little or nometabolism was observed with cDNA-expressed CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1.
6.
7.
Kinetic analysis of NADPH-dependent 7BQmetabolism to <START:DRUG> 7-hydroxyquinoline <END> ( <START:DRUG> 7HQ <END> ) in human liver microsomes revealed Km and Vmax = 70 microM and 3.39 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively.
8.
While 80 microM7BQ was metabolized to <START:DRUG> 7HQ <END> by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4, only low rates of metabolism were observed with cDNA-expressed CYPIA2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1.
9.
BFBFCmay be a useful fluorescent probe substrate for human hepatic CYP3A4, but compared with <START:DRUG> 7BQ <END> has only a low rate of metabolism in human liver microsomes.
Good correlations(r2 = 0.736-0.904) were observed between BFBFCmetabolism and markers of CYP3A isoforms.
The metabolism of 10 microMBFBFC in human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by 5-50 microMtroleandomycin and 0.2-5 microMketoconazole, but stimulated by 0.2-10 microM <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> .
The metabolism of 10 microMBFBFC in human liver microsomes was also markedly inhibited by an antibody to CYP3A4.
In summary, by correlation analysis, the use of cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms, chemical inhibition and inhibitory antibodies, BFBFCmetabolism in human liver microsomes appears to be primarily catalysed by CYP3A4.
Inhibition of human CYP1A2 activity in vitro by <START:DRUG> methylxanthines <END> : potent competitive inhibition by <START:DRUG> 8-phenyltheophylline <END> .
1.
Humans are exposed in vivo to <START:DRUG> methylxanthines <END> by dietary ingestion, as well as from their use as therapeutic agents.
The inhibitory effect of a series of these compounds on high-affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity in the human liver microsomal fraction, a measure of CYP1A2 activity, has been evaluated.
2.
 <START:DRUG> paracetamol <END> , the product of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity, was analysed by gas chromatography/negative-ion mass spectrometry using a novel bistrifluoromethylbenzoyl/ trimethylsilyl derivative, and incubation conditions for assessing high-affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity were examined and optimized.
3.
4.
5.
No inhibition of any of these activities was observed.
6.
1-Methylxanthine, <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> , <START:DRUG> 8-methylxanthine <END> , <START:DRUG> pentoxyfylline <END> and <START:DRUG> 3isobutyl-1-methylxanthine <END> caused moderate inhibition with IC50 = 260, 140, 120, 100, 62 and 36 microM respectively.
 <START:DRUG> 8-phenyltheophylline <END> was a potent competitive inhibitor of high-affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity with an IC50 = 0.7 microM and Ki = 0.11 microM.
The specificity of inhibition by <START:DRUG> 8-phenyltheophylline <END> was assessed by measuring its effect on <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> 4-hydroxylase (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> hydroxylase (CYP3A4), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylase (CYP2E1) and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-hydroxylase (CYP2C9) activities in human liver microsomal fraction.
The potency and specificity of <START:DRUG> 8-phenyltheophylline <END> as an inhibitor of human hepatic CYP1A2 indicate that the compound may be useful as a chemical inhibitor of this enzyme for further in vitro studies.
Inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> on simvastatinmetabolism in human liver microsomes.
To determine the effects of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> on simvastatinmetabolism in human liver microsomes and to compare their inhibitory potencies and CYP3A4inactivation parameters with those reported previously for <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> .
Simvastatinmetabolism was investigated in human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> or <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> (0.1-250 microM).
Kinetics of CYP3A4inactivation by <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> were determined using <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> as the substrate.
The IC50 values ranged from 4.8 to 5.6 microM on preincubation of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> for 30 min in the presence of an NADPH-generating system.
Corresponding IC50 values for <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> ranged from 110-127 microM and from 21-27 microM, respectively.
The IC50 values for coincubation of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> were 46- and 220-foldhigher, respectively, than those reported previously for <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> , and 16- and 71-foldhigher, respectively, for preincubation.
Thus, the results of this study suggest that <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> are less likely than <START:DRUG> mibefradil <END> to cause acute drug interactions with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> in vivo.
When <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> was coincubated with <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , IC50 values ranged from 23 to 26 microM for all major metabolites.
 <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and diltiazeminhibitedtestosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, key features of mechanism-based inactivation.
Values for the inactivation parameters kinact and KI were 0.15 +/- 0.04 min-1 (mean +/- s.d.) and 2.9 +/- 0.6 microM, respectively, for <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and 0.07 +/- 0.01 min-1 and 3.3 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively, for <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> and <START:DRUG> diltiazem <END> are moderate mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP3A4 and therefore may still cause significant inhibition of simvastatinmetabolism in vivo during chronic therapy.
Role of CYP2C9 polymorphism in losartanoxidation.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is oxidized by hepatic cytochromes P450 to an active carboxylic acid metabolite, <START:DRUG> e-3174 <END> .
The aim of the present investigation was to study the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in losartanoxidation in vitro and to evaluate the role of CYP2C9 polymorphism.
Kinetic properties of different genetic CYP2C9 variants were compared both in a yeast expression system and in 25 different samples of human liver microsomes where all known genotypes of CYP2C9 were represented.
Microsomes were incubated with <START:DRUG> losartan <END> (0.05-50 microM), and the formation of <START:DRUG> e-3174 <END> was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to estimate V(max), K(m), and intrinsic clearance for all individual samples.
In comparison to the CYP2C9.1 variant, oxidation of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> was significantly reduced in yeast expressing the rare CYP2C9.2 or CYP2C9.3 variants.
Moreover, the rate of losartanoxidation was lower in liver microsomes from individuals hetero- or homozygous for the CYP2C9*3 allele, or homozygous for the CYP2C9*2 allele.
The difference between the common and rare CYP2C9 variants was mainly explained by a lower V(max), both in yeast and human liver microsomes.
In summary, these in vitro results indicate that CYP2C9 is the major human P450 isoenzyme responsible for losartanoxidation and that the CYP2C9 genotype contributes to interindividual differences in losartanoxidation and activation.
 <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , a CYP2C9 inhibitor, blocked the formation of <START:DRUG> e-3174 <END> at low <START:DRUG> losartan <END> concentrations (<1 microM), whereas the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> triacetyloleandomycin <END> , a CYP3A4 inhibitor, was significant only at high concentrations of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> (>25 microM).
Species difference in stereoselective involvement of CYP3A in the mono-N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> disopyramide <END> .
1.
To determine which CYP isoenzyme is involved in the N-dealkylation of <START:DRUG> disopyramide <END> (DP)metabolism in human and dog, and to determine the stereoselectivity of DPmetabolism with human CYP and dog CYP isoenzymes, the following in vitro metabolism studies of DP were conducted: correlation between human CYP isoenzyme activities and DPmetabolism with human liver microsomes; inhibition of DPmetabolism in human and dog liver microsomes with chemical inhibitors of CYP isoenzymes; inhibition of DP metabolism in human microsomes with human CYP antibodies; inhibition of DP metabolism in dog liver microsomes with human and dog CYP antibodies; metabolism of DP with human (CYP3A4) and dog (CYP3A12) cDNA-expressed isoenzymes; determination of Km and Vmax of DP enantiomers by using cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A12.
2.
DP was metabolized by cDNA-expressed CYP3A isoenzymes.
In dog liver microsomes, DPmetabolism was inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , TA and dog anti-CYP3A12.
DP was also metabolized by cDNA-expressed CYP3A12.
3.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A12 are the principal isoenzymes involved in DPmetabolism in human and dog respectively.
There was no stereoselectivity in N-dealkylation of DP by human CYP3A4.
However, there was notable stereoselectivity in the N-dealkylation by dog CYP3A12.
In human liver microsomes, the formation of the <START:DRUG> mono-N-dealkylated <END> <START:DRUG> disopyramide <END> (MNDP) metabolite was best correlated with CYP3A4 activities.
DPmetabolism was substantially inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (TA); and human CYP3A4 antibody.
Clinical pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> , the first fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce <START:DRUG> cholesterol <END> in patients with hyperlipidaemia, to prevent subsequent coronary events in patients with established coronary heart disease, and to alter endothelial function and plaque stability in animal models.
 <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> is relatively hydrophilic, compared with the semisynthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and, therefore, it is extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
After absorption, it is nearly completely extracted and metabolised in the liver to 2 hydroxylated metabolites and an N-desisopropyl metabolite, which are excreted in the bile.
Approximately 95% of a dose is recovered in the faeces, with 60% of a dose recovered as the 3 metabolites.
The 6-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolites are exclusively generated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and do not accumulate in the blood.
CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 form the 5-hydroxy <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> metabolite.
Because of its hydrophilic nature and extensive plasma protein binding, <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> has a small volume of distribution with minimal concentrations in extrahepatic tissues.
The pharmacokinetics of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> are not influenced by renal function, due to its extensive metabolism and biliary excretion; limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest a 30%reduction in oral clearance.
Age and gender do not appear to affect the disposition of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> .
In addition to being a CYP2C9substrate, <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> demonstrates inhibitory effects on this isoenzyme in vitro and in vivo.
These alterations have not been shown to be clinically significant.
There are inadequate data evaluating the potential interaction of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> with <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> , 2 CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and caution is recommended when using <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> with these agents.
 <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> does not appear to have a significant effect on other CYP isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.
CYP3A4 inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> ) have no effect on <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> pharmacokinetics, in contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are primarily metabolised by CYP3A and are subject to potential drug interactions with CYP3Ainhibitors.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> with gastrointestinal agents such as <START:DRUG> cholestyramine <END> , and gastric acid regulating agents (H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors), significantly alters <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> disposition by decreasing and increasing bioavailability, respectively.
The nonspecific CYP inducerrifampicin ( <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> )significantlyincreasesfluvastatin oral clearance.
In human liver microsomes, fluvastatinsignificantly inhibits the hydroxylation of 2 CYP2C9 substrates, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> and <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> .
The oral clearances of the CYP2C9 substrates <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> ( <START:DRUG> glyburide <END> ) and <START:DRUG> losartan <END> are reduced by 15 to 25% when coadministered with <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> .
Evaluation of <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> , <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , and <START:DRUG> tryptamine <END> as specific and selective CYP2A6 inhibitors in vitro.
CYP2A6 is the principle enzyme metabolizingnicotine to its inactive metabolite cotinine.
In this study, the selective probe reactions for each major cytochrome P450 (P450) were used to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of the CYP2A6 inhibitorsmethoxsalen, <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , and <START:DRUG> tryptamine <END> in cDNA-expressing and human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6), <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> 5-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6), 7-ethoxy-4- <START:DRUG> trifluoromethylcoumarin <END> deethylation (CYP2B6), <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfonation (CYP3A4) were used as index reactions.
 <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> [particularly R-(+) isomer], <START:DRUG> tryptamine <END> , and <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> are specific and relatively selective for CYP2A6 and may be useful in vivo to increase smoking by inhibiting nicotinemetabolism with a low risk of metabolic drug interactions.
Apparent K(i) values for inhibition of P450s' (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) activities showed that <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> , and <START:DRUG> tryptamine <END> have high specificity and relative selectivity for CYP2A6.
In cDNA-expressing microsomes, <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> inhibitedCYP2A6 (K(i) = 0.08 microM) with about 60- to 5000-foldgreater potency relative to other P450s.
 <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> inhibitedCYP2A6 (K(i) = 0.8 microM) with about 3.5- 94-foldgreater potency than other P450s, except for CYP1A2 (K(i) = 0.2 microM).
 <START:DRUG> tryptamine <END> inhibitedCYP2A6 (K(i) = 1.7 microM) with about 6.5- 213-foldgreater potency relative to other P450s, except for CYP1A2 (K(i) = 1.7 microM).
Similar results were also obtained with <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> and <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> in human liver microsomes.
R-(+)- <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , (+/-)- <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , and S-(-)- <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> competitively inhibitedCYP2A6-mediated metabolism of <START:DRUG> nicotine <END> with apparent K(i) values of 0.05, 0.08, and 2.0 microM, respectively.
Involvement of CYP2B6 in n-demethylation of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) leading to production of pharmacologically active products and contributing to drug excretion.
We identified the CYP enzymes involved in the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> enantiomers using pooled human liver microsomes and microsomes from human B-lymphoblastoid cells that expressed CYP enzymes.
The kinetic data in human liver microsomes for the (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> N-demethylase activities could be analyzed as two-enzyme systems.
The K(m) values were 31 and 496 microM for (R)- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> , and 24 and 444 microM for (S)- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> .
Among the 12 cDNA-expressed CYP enzymes examined, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 showed high activities for the N-demethylation of both enantiomers at the substrate concentration of 1 mM.
CYP2B6 had the lowest K(m) value for the N-demethylation of (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> (74 and 44 microM, respectively).
Also, the intrinsic clearance (CL(int): V(max)/K(m)) of CYP2B6 for the N-demethylation of both enantiomers were 7 to 13 times higher than those of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
These results suggest that the high affinity/low capacity enzyme in human liver microsomes is mediated by CYP2B6, and the low affinity/high capacity enzyme is mediated by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
CYP2B6 mainly mediates the N-demethylation of (R)- and (S)- <START:DRUG> ketamine <END> in human liver microsomes at therapeutic concentrations (5 microM).
 <START:DRUG> orphenadrine <END> (CYP2B6 inhibitor, 500 microM) and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9 inhibitor, 100 microM) inhibited the N-demethylase activities for both enantiomers (5 microM) in human liver microsomes by 60 to 70%, whereas <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A (CYP3A4 inhibitor, 100 microM) failed to inhibit these activities.
In addition, the anti-CYP2B6 antibody inhibited these activities in human liver microsomes by 80%, whereas anti-CYP2C antibody and anti-CYP3A4 antibody failed to inhibit these activities.
Inhibition of drug metabolism in human liver microsomes by <START:DRUG> nizatidine <END> , <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
1.
The inhibitory effects of <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> , <START:DRUG> nizatidine <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> on the metabolic activity of CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A were investigated in human liver microsomes.
2.
The ability to inhibitCYP2C9 varied with incubation time, as measured by the metabolic rate constant for the substrates.
Therefore, suitable substrates and incubation times must be selected in inhibition studies examining metabolic clearance and the mechanism of inhibition of these drugs.
3.
To avoid drug-drug interactions, care needs to be taken to select suitable medicines for co-administration with anti-ulcer drugs.
Both <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> inhibited each of the CYP subfamily enzymes; in particular, <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> extensively inhibited the hydroxylation of S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> (CYP2C19, Ki = 7.1 microM).
 <START:DRUG> nizatidine <END> exhibited noinhibition of any of the CYP isoforms examined.
 <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> inhibited the hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> but not of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , whereas <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> inhibited the hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> but not that of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> .
 <START:DRUG> nizatidine <END> did not inhibit the metabolism of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> , <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> , <START:DRUG> benidipine <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> inhibited the metabolism of <START:DRUG> cisapride <END> (Ki = 0.4 microM), <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> (11.7 microM) and <START:DRUG> benidipine <END> (6.5 microM), whereas <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> inhibited the metabolism of <START:DRUG> glibenclamide <END> (11.6 microM).
The role of CYP2C in the in vitro bioactivation of the contraceptive steroid <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> .
 <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> is a 3-deoxo progestogenic steroid that requires bioactivation to <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> .
In these studies we have attempted to define the pathway of <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> formation and characterise the enzymes responsible for this biotransformation in vitro.
Initial studies using deuterated <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> confirmed that <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> is metabolised by human liver microsomes via 3alpha-hydroxy and 3beta-hydroxydesogestrel to <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> .
Metabolites were analysed by radiometric high-performance liquid chromatography and were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and by cochromatography with authentic standards.
 <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> was metabolised by microsomes from lymphoblasts containing cDNA-expressed CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to 3alpha-hydroxydesogestrel with small amounts of 3beta-hydroxydesogestrel also being observed.
The Km value for 3alpha-hydroxylation by CYP2C9 cell line microsomes was 6.5 microM and the corresponding Vmax value was 1269 pmole.
mg-1.min-1.
There was a significant negative correlation between <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> and CYP3A4 content/activity in a panel of human livers suggesting that the further metabolism of <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> is mediated by CYP3A4.
This was confirmed in incubations with inhibitory antibodies.
Whereas an anti-CYP2C9/2C19 antibody completely abolished desogestrelmetabolism, anti-CYP3A4 and anti-CYP2E1 were not inhibitory.
We conclude that CYP2C9 and possibly CYP2C19 and important isoforms catalysing the initial hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> desogestrel <END> .
 <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> potently inhibited 3alpha-hydroxydesogestrel formation by CYP2C9 microsomes with a Ki value of 0.91 microM.
 <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> partially inhibited 3alpha-hydroxydesogestrel and <START:DRUG> 3-ketodesogestrel <END> formation in human liver microsomes indicating a possible in vivo role for CYP2C9.
In addition, when <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> was combined with S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , further inhibition of 3alpha-hydroxydesogestrel formation was observed suggesting a possible role for CYP2C19.
In-vitro characterization of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in the back oxidation and N-dealkylation of reduced <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> .
In-vitro studies were performed using human liver microsomes and c-DNA-expressed human P450 isoforms to identify the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme(s) involved in the back oxidation and N-dealkylation of reduced <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> .
Back oxidation and N-dealkylation of reduced <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> were assessed by measuring the formation of <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidine (CPHP), respectively.
The <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and CPHPformation rates as a function of substrate concentration, measured in three livers, followed monophasic enzyme kinetics.
For haloperidolformationKm values ranged from 51-59 microM, and Vmax values from 190-334 pmol mg(-1) min(-1); for CPHPformationKm values were 44-49 microM, and Vmax values 74-110 pmol mg(-1) min(-1).
Among the recombinant human CYP isoforms tested, CYP3A4 exhibited the highest activity with respect to <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and CPHPformation rates, with no detectable effect of CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
These results strongly suggest that back oxidation and N-dealkylation of reduced <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> in human liver microsomal preparations are mediated by CYP3A4.
 <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and CPHPformation rates in the nine liver preparations were significantlycorrelated with <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> N-demethylase activity (a marker of CYP3A4 activity), but not with the CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , inhibitors of CYP3A4, inhibited competitively both <START:DRUG> haloperidol <END> and CPHPformation, with a Ki value lower than 0.2 microM for <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and lower than 0.3 microM for <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (CYP1A2) and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> (CYP2D6) gave only little inhibition (IC50> 60 microM).
CPHP and haloperidolformation were, moreover, enhanced by <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , an effect known for CYP3A4 mediated reactions.
Anti-CYP3A4 antibodies strongly inhibitedhaloperidol and CPHPformation, whereas CYP2D6 antibodies did not.
Microsomal metabolism of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> : evidence for mechanism-based inactivation of human cytochrome P450 3A.
Administration of <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, to rats or monkeys resulted in apparent loss of hepatic microsomal CYP3A and <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> desalkylation activity.
The catalytic activity loss was saturable and was characterized by a Ki of 21.6 +/- 8.9 microM and a kinact of 0.59 +/- 0.08 min-1.
An apparent partition ratio of 41 was determined with cDNA expressed CYP3A4, based on the substrate depletion method.
Incubation of [14C] <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> with microsomes from several species resulted in irreversible association with an approximately 50 kDa protein, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography.
Binding to the protein was NADPH dependent, <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> insensitive, proportional to the level of CYP3A expression and was inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a specific CYP3Ainhibitor.
NADPH-dependent irreversible binding to human and rat total microsomal protein was demonstrated following exhaustive extraction of microsomal protein.
These results suggest that <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> can inactivateCYP3A and has the potential to slow the metabolism of coadministered CYP3A substrates.
Human CYP3A catalyzes the formation of desalkyl <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> and 6'-hydroxy <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> , an unstable metabolite, while CYP2D6 catalyzes only desalkyl <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> .
CYP2D6catalyzed desalkyl delavirdineformation was linear with time (up to 30 min) but when catalyzed by cDNA expressed CYP3A4 or human liver microsomes the reaction rate declined progressively with time.
Coincubation with <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> showed that <START:DRUG> delavirdine <END> caused a time- and NADPH-dependent loss of CYP3A4 activity in human liver microsomes as measured by <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation.
Binding was decreased in the presence of <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> and appeared to be related to expression level of CYP3A.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> hydroxylation (Cytochrome P450-2D6) in vitro by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and by viral protease inhibitors: relation to drug interactions in vivo.
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with viral protease inhibitors are of potential clinical importance.
An in vitro model was applied to the quantitative identification of possible interactions of protease inhibitors with substrates of cytochrome P450-2D6.
Biotransformation of <START:DRUG> desipramine <END> (DMI) to <START:DRUG> hydroxydesipramine <END> ( <START:DRUG> oH-DMI <END> ), an index reaction used to profile activity of human cytochrome P450-2D6, was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and four viral protease inhibitors currently used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection were tested as chemical inhibitors in this system.
Formation of <START:DRUG> oH-DMI <END> from DMI was consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, having a mean Km value of 11.7 microM (range: 9.9-15.3 microM).
The in vitro findings, together with observed plasma <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> concentrations, provided a reasonable quantitative forecast of this interaction, whereas estimated unbound plasma or intrahepatic <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> concentrations yielded poor quantitative forecasts.
Thus the in vitro model correctly identifies <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> as a potent and clinically important inhibitor of human P450-2D6.
Other protease inhibitorsmay also inhibit2D6 activity in humans, but with lower potency than <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a highly potent and relatively selective inhibitor of P450-2D6, strongly inhibited <START:DRUG> oH-DMI <END> formation with an apparent competitive mechanism, having a mean inhibition constant of 0.16 microM (range: 0.13-0.18 microM).
All four protease inhibitors impaired <START:DRUG> oH-DMI <END> formation; the pattern was consistent with a mixed competitive-noncompetitive mechanism.
Mean inhibition constants (small numbers indicating greaterinhibiting potency) were as follows: <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , 4.8 microM; <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> , 15.6 microM; <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> , 24.0 microM; <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> , 51.9 microM.
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, coadministration of <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> with DMIinhibitedDMIclearance by an average of 59%.
 <START:DRUG> 3,3'-diindolylmethane <END> induces CYP1A2 in cultured precision-cut human liver slices.
1.
The effect of <START:DRUG> 3,3'-diindolylmethane <END> (DIM), an <START:DRUG> indole <END> derivative derived from cruciferous vegetables, on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms in the CYP1A and CYP3A subfamilies has been studied in 72-h cultured human liver slices.
2.
In cultured human liver slices 50 microMDIMinduced 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase and to a lesser extent 7-methoxyresorufin O-demethylase activities.
3.
Western immunoblotting of liver slice microsomes was performed with antibodies to rat CYP1A2 and human CYP3A4.
4.
Some variability in the magnitude of induction of enzyme activities by DIM was observed in four human liver samples examined.
5.
These results demonstrate that cultured human liver slices can be used to evaluate the effect of chemicals derived from cruciferous and other vegetables on CYP isoforms.
Compared with control liver slice microsomes (dimethyl sulphoxide-only treated), DIMinduced levels of CYP1A2 but had little effect on levels of CYP3A4.
The treatment of human liver slices with 2 microg/ml of the polycholorinated biphenyl mixture <START:DRUG> aroclor 1254 <END> also resulted in an induction of levels of CYP1A2, but had no effect on CYP3A4.
These results demonstrate that DIM induces CYP1A isoforms in cultured human liver slices.
For 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase, the magnitude of induction by 50 microMDIM ranged from 2.3- to 19.3-fold.
Involvement of CYP1A2 in mexiletinemetabolism.
 <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> has been reported to be hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in humans.
However, the involvement of CYP1A2 in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> has been proposed based on the interaction with <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> which is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2.
The aim of this study was to clarify the role of human CYP1A2 in mexiletinemetabolism.
Human CYP isoforms involved in mexiletinemetabolism were investigated using microsomes from human liver and B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing human CYPs.
The contributions of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 to mexiletinemetabolism were estimated by the relative activity factor (RAF).
 <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> p- and 2-hydroxylase activities in microsomes from nine human livers correlatedsignificantly with <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.907, P < 0.001 and r = 0.886, P < 0.01, respectively).
However, the Km values of the expressed CYP1A2 (approximately 15 microM) were almost identical with those of the expressed CYP2D6 (approximately 22 microM) and human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> is a substrate of CYP1A2.
The data obtained in this study suggest that the interaction of <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> with <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> might be due to competitive inhibition of CYP1A2.
 <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> p- and 2-hydroxylase activities in human liver microsomes were inhibited by <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> and <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> as well as <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
Microsomes of B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing human CYP1A2 exhibited lower <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> p- and 2-hydroxylase activities than those expressing human CYP2D6.
It was estimated by RAF that the major isoform involved in mexiletinemetabolism was CYP2D6, and the contribution of CYPIA2 to both <START:DRUG> mexiletine <END> p- and 2-hydroxylase activities was 7-30% in human liver microsomes.
Characterization of the selectivity and mechanism of human cytochrome P450 inhibition by the human immunodeficiency virus-protease inhibitornelfinavir mesylate.
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and P450 probe substrates were performed to characterize selectivity and mechanism of cytochrome P450 inhibition by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> mesylate.
At therapeutic concentrations (steady-state plasma concentrations approximately 4 microM), <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> was found to be a competitive inhibitor of only <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase (CYP3A4) with a Ki concentration of 4.8 microM.
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> in vitro was NADPH-dependent requiring the catalytic formation of a metabolite or a metabolic intermediate.
The catechol metabolite of <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> (M3) was considered unlikely to be responsible for inhibition as the addition of catechol O-methyl transferase, S-adenosyl methionine, and ascorbic acid to the preincubation mixture did not protect against the loss of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase activity.
Also, the addition of M3 to human liver microsomes did not inhibitCYP3A4.
Although incubations with <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> showed a time- and concentration-dependent loss of CYP3A4 activity, the partial or complete recovery of enzyme activity upon dialysis indicated that inhibition was reversible.
Microsomal incubations with <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> and NADPH did not result in a loss of spectral P450 content compared with the NADPH control.
Collectively, these results suggest that the probable mechanism for CYP3A4 inhibition by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> is a transient metabolic intermediate or stable metabolite that coordinates tightly but reversibly to the <START:DRUG> heme <END> moiety of the P450.
At supratherapeutic concentrations, <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> competitively inhibiteddextromethorphan O-demethylase (CYP2D6), S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4-hydroxylase (CYP2C19), and <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase (CYP1A2) with Ki concentrations of 68, 126, and 190 microM respectively.
 <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> did not appreciably inhibittolbutamide 4-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> paclitaxel <END> 6alpha-hydroxylase (CYP2C8), or <START:DRUG> chlorzoxaxone <END> 6beta-hydroxylase (CYP2E1) activities.
The inhibitory potency of <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> toward CYP3A4 suggested the possibility of in vivo inhibition of this isoform, whereas in vivo inhibition of other P450s was considered unlikely.
In a one-sequence crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers, nelfinavirinhibited the elimination of the CYP3A substrate <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and the carboxylate metabolite of <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> .
The 24-hr urinary recoveries of 6beta-hydroxycortisol were reduced by an average of 27% during <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> treatment, consistent with CYP3Ainhibition by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> .
 <START:DRUG> glutathione <END> , N- <START:DRUG> acetylcysteine <END> , and catalase did not attenuate CYP3A4 inhibition by <START:DRUG> nelfinavir <END> .
Prediction of drug-drug interactions of zonisamidemetabolism in humans from in vitro data.
The purposes of this study were to identify the P450 enzyme (CYP) responsible for zonisamidemetabolism in humans by using expressed human CYPs and to predict drug interaction of <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> in vivo from in vitro data.
Ten expressed human CYPs and human liver microsomes were used in the experiments for the identification of enzymes responsible for zonisamidemetabolism and for the prediction of drug-drug interactions of zonisamidemetabolism in humans from in vitro data, respectively.
Two-sulfamoylacetyl <START:DRUG> phenol <END> , a reductive metabolite of <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> , was measured by the HPLC method.
However, an intrinsic clearance, Vmax/kM, of CYP3A4 was much higher than those of CYP2C19 and CYP3A5.
From the point of view of enzyme amount in human liver CYPs isoform and their intrinsic clearance, it was suggested that CYP3A4 is mainly responsible for zonisamidemetabolism in human CYPs.
We estimated the possibility and degree of change of zonisamideclearance in vivo in clinical dose range from in vitro inhibition constant of other drugs against zonisamidemetabolism (Ki) and unbound inhibitor concentration in blood (Iu) in clinical usage.
On the other hand, there may be lack of interaction of zonisamidemetabolism by <START:DRUG> dihydroergotamine <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> in clinical dose range.
We demonstrated that: (1) <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> is metabolized by recombinant CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP3A5, (2) the metabolism is inhibited to a variable extent by known CYP3A4/5 substrates and/or inhibitors in human liver microsomes, and (3) in vitro-in vivo predictive calculations suggest that several compounds demonstrating CYP3A4-affinity might cause in vivo drug-drug interactions with <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> .
From the experiments using ten expressed human CYPs, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were shown to be capable of catalyzing <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> reduction.
Zonisamidemetabolism in human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A, <START:DRUG> dihydroergotamine <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> .
Clearance of <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> was maximally estimated to decrease by 31%, 23% and 17% of the clearance without inhibitors i.e. <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , cyclospolin A and <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> carbamazepine <END> are estimated to decrease by 5-6% of the clearance of <START:DRUG> zonisamide <END> .
Metabolism of 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (NSC 330507) by murine and human hepatic preparations.
17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> ), a compound that is proposed for clinical development, shares the ability of <START:DRUG> geldanamycin <END> to bind to heat shock protein 90 and GRP94, thereby depleting cells of p185erbB2, mutant p53, and Raf-1.
Urine and plasma from mice treated i.v.
with <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> contained six materials with absorption spectra similar to that of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> .
Therefore, in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> by mouse and human hepatic preparations was studied to characterize: (a) the enzymes responsible for <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> metabolism; and (b) the structures of the metabolites produced.
These materials had retention times on high-performance liquid chromatography of approximately 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 min.
When incubated in an aerobic environment with <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> , murine hepatic supernatant (9000 x g) produced each of these compounds; the 4-min metabolite was the major product.
This metabolism required an electron donor, and NADPH was favored over NADH.
Metabolic activity resided predominantly in the microsomal fraction.
Metabolism was decreased by approximately 80% in anaerobic conditions and was essentially ablated by CO.
Microsomes prepared from human livers produced essentially the same metabolites as produced by murine hepatic microsomes, but the 2-min metabolite was the major product, and the 4-min metabolite was next largest.
There was no metabolism of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> by human liver cytosol.
Metabolism of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> by human liver microsomes also required an electron donor, with NADPH being preferred over NADH, was inhibited by approximately 80% under anaerobic conditions, and was essentially ablated by CO.
Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of human and mouse in vitro reaction mixtures indicated the presence of materials with molecular weights of 545, 601, and 619, compatible with 17-(amino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( <START:DRUG> 17AG <END> ), an epoxide, and a diol, respectively.
The metabolite with retention time of 4 min was identified as <START:DRUG> 17AG <END> by cochromatography and mass spectral concordance with authentic standard.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> with cloned CYP3A4 produced metabolites 4 and 6.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> with cloned CYP3A4 and cloned microsomal epoxide hydrolase produced metabolites 2 and 4, with greatlydecreased amounts of metabolite 6.
These data imply that metabolite 2 is a diol and metabolite 6 is an epoxide.
Mass spectral fragmentation patterns and the fact that <START:DRUG> 17AG <END> is not metabolized argue for the epoxide and diol being formed on the 17-allylamino portion of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> and not on its ansamycin ring.
These data have implications with regard to preclinical toxicology and activity testing of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> as well as its proposed clinical development because: (a) production of <START:DRUG> 17AG <END> requires concomitant production of acrolein from the cleaved allyl moiety; and (b) <START:DRUG> 17AG <END> , which was not metabolized by microsomes, has been described as being as active as <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> in decreasing cellular p185erbB2.
Human microsomal metabolism of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> was inhibited by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , implying 3A4 as the responsible cytochrome P450 isoform.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> 17AAG <END> with human hepatic microsomes and cyclohexene oxide, a known inhibitor of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, did not affect the production of metabolite 4 but decreased the production of metabolite 2 while increasing the production of metabolite 6.
Overlapping substrate specificities of cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein for a novel <START:DRUG> cysteine <END> protease inhibitor.
K02 (morpholine- <START:DRUG> urea <END> -Phe-Hphe-vinylsulfone), a newly developed peptidomimetic, acts as a potent <START:DRUG> cysteine <END> protease inhibitor, especially of cathepsins B and L (which are associated with cancer progression) and cruzain (a <START:DRUG> cysteine <END> protease of Trypanosoma cruzi, which is responsible for Chagas' disease).
Here we investigated features of the disposition of K02 using in vitro systems, characterizing the interaction of the drug with human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a mediator of multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancer chemotherapy and a countertransporter in the intestine that limits oral drug bioavailability.
P-gp functions as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump to reduce intracellular cytotoxic concentrations.
An HPLC assay was developed to analyze K02 and its metabolites formed in human liver microsomes.
Three major primary metabolites were determined by LC/MS/MS to be hydroxylated products of the parent compound.
A rabbit anti-CYP3A polyclonal antibody (200 microl antibody/mg microsomal protein) produced 75-94% inhibition of the formation of these three hydroxylated metabolites.
An identical metabolite formation profile for K02 was observed with cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 (Gentest).
These data demonstrate that K02 is a substrate for CYP3A.
Transport studies with [14C]K02, using MDR1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers in the Transwell system, demonstrated that the basolateral-to-apical flux of K02 across MDR1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was markedlygreater than the apical-to-basolateral flux (ratio of 63 with 10 microM [14C]K02).
This suggests that K02 is also a P-gp substrate.
These studies are important for formulating strategies to increase the absorption and/or decrease the elimination of K02 and to optimize its delivery to malignant cells and parasite-infected host cells.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (5 microM), a selective CYP3Ainhibitor, produced up to 75% inhibition, whereas other CYP-specific inhibitors, i.e. <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (CYP2D6), <START:DRUG> 7,8-benzoflavone <END> (CYP1A2), and <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9), showed nosignificant effects.
Formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam, the primary human <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> metabolite, was markedly inhibited by K02 via competitive processes, which suggests the potential for drug-drug interactions of K02 with other CYP3A substrates.
K02 significantly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of P-gp with <START:DRUG> azidopine <END> and <START:DRUG> lU-49888 <END> , a photoaffinity analogue of <START:DRUG> verapamil <END> .
Identification and characterization of human cytochrome P450 isoforms interacting with <START:DRUG> pimozide <END> .
Using human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoforms, we identified the major route of pimozidemetabolism, the CYP450 isoforms involved, and documented the inhibitory effect of <START:DRUG> pimozide <END> on CYP450 isoforms.
 <START:DRUG> pimozide <END> was predominantly N-dealkylated to 1,3-dihydro-1-(4-piperidinyl)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (DHPBI).
The formation rate of DHPBI showed biphasic kinetics in HLMs, which suggests the participation of at least two activities.
These were characterized as high-affinity (K(m1) and Vmax1) and low-affinity (K(m2) and Vmax2) components.
The ratio of Vmax1 (14 pmol/min/mg protein)/K(m1) (0.73 microM) was 5.2 times higher than the ratio of Vmax2 (244 pmol/min/mg protein)/K(m2) (34 microM).
K(m2) was 91 times higher than K(m1).
The formation rate of DHPBI from 25 microMpimozide in nine human livers correlatedsignificantly with the catalytic activity of CYP3A (Spearman r = 0.79, P = .028), but not with other isoforms.
The K(m) values derived with recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were 5.7 microM and 36.1 microM, respectively.
Pimozidemetabolism is likely to be subject to interindividual variability in CYP3A and CYP1A2 expression and to drug interactions involving these isoforms.
 <START:DRUG> pimozide <END> itself may inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6.
Potent inhibition of DHPBI formation from 10 microMpimozide was observed with <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (88%), <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (79%), <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (48%) and a combination of <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (96%).
Recombinant human CYP3A4catalyzed DHPBI formation from 10 microMpimozide at the highest rate (V = 2.2 +/- 0.89 pmol/min/pmol P450) followed by CYP1A2 (V = 0.23 +/- 0.08 pmol/min/pmol P450), but other isoforms tested did not.
 <START:DRUG> pimozide <END> itself was a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in HLMs when preincubated for 15 min (Ki = 0.75 +/- 0.98 microM) and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A (Ki = 76.7 +/- 34.5 microM), with nosignificant effect on other isoforms tested.
Our results suggest that pimozidemetabolism is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A, but CYP1A2 also contributes.
 <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> as an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 enzymes.
1.
Reduction of theophyllinemetabolism and elimination were observed in a <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> -treated patient during <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> administration.
After withdrawal of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> , the serum <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> level decreased to an extent similar to that found before administration of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> .
The effects of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> and its major metabolites 7-hydroxy-isoflavone and 7-(1-carboxy-ethoxy)-isoflavone on cytochrome P450 activities were studied in vitro in human liver microsomes from three donors.
2.
The parent compound and its dealkylated metabolite were strong inhibitors exhibiting Ki values around 10-20 microM, while 7-(1-carboxy-ethoxy)-isoflavone had no effect on the cytochrome P450 activities investigated.
It competitively inhibited this activity with a Ki value of 129.5 microM.
3.
The steady state concentrations of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> and 7-hydroxy-isoflavone in plasma of patients receiving 3 x 200 mg daily doses of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> for 48 weeks were found to be 0.33 +/- 0.32 microM and 1.44 +/- 0.77 microM, respectively.
4.
On the other hand, our in vitro findings predict some more interaction with CYP2C9.
 <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> and 7-hydroxy-isoflavone competitively inhibitedphenacetin O-deethylase and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylase activity.
7-Hydroxy-isoflavone is the only one that influenced <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidase activity.
The results indicate that the decrease in theophyllinemetabolism observed in a patient treated with Ipriflavonemay be due to a competitive interaction of <START:DRUG> ipriflavone <END> or its metabolite, 7-hydroxy-isoflavone with CYP1A2.
Mutual inhibition between <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> by human liver microsomes.
Evidence for cytochrome P4503A4 involvement in their major metabolic pathways.
The mutual inhibition between <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> with their major metabolic pathways (i.e. <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> 3'-demethylation) was examined in vitro by human liver microsomes.
An excellent correlation (r = 0.947, p < 0.01) between <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylase and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> 3'-demethylase activities in six different human liver microsomes was observed.
 <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> inhibitedquinine 3-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner with a mean IC50 of 65 microM.
The mean maximum inhibition by <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> (100 micro) of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylation was about 60%.
Similarly, <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> 3'-demethylation was inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in a concentration-related manner with a mean IC50 value of 90 microM.
The mean maximum inhibition by <START:DRUG> quinine <END> (100 M) of <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> 3'-demethylation was about 52%.
Two inhibitors of CYP3A4, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (1 microM) and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (100 microM), inhibitedquinine 3-hydroxylation by about 90% and 80%, and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> 3'-demethylation by about 75% and 65%, respectively.
We conclude that <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> mutually inhibit the metabolism of each other, consistent with the previous finding that CYP3A4 catalyzes the metabolism of both substrates.
Differential selectivity of cytochrome P450 inhibitors against probe substrates in human and rat liver microsomes.
Chemical inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) are a useful tool in defining the role of individual CYPs involved in drug metabolism.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the selectivity and rank the order of potency of a range of isoform-selective CYP inhibitors and to compare directly the effects of these inhibitors in human and rat hepatic microsomes.
Four chemical inhibitors of human cytochrome P450 isoforms, <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> (CYP2E1), and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (CYP3A4) were screened for their inhibitory specificity towards CYP-mediated reactions in both human and rat liver microsomal preparations.
 <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation, <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation were monitored for enzyme activity.
Although inhibitingCYP3A in rat liver it also inhibited all other reactions at concentrations < or = 5 microM.
It is evident that CYP inhibitors do not exhibit the same selectivity in human and rat liver microsomes.
This is due to differential selectivity of the inhibitors and/or differences in the CYP isoform responsible for metabolism in the different species.
 <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> was a potent, selective inhibitor of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation (CYP1A2-mediated) in human liver microsomes (IC50 = 0.48 microM), but inhibited both <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C9-mediated) at equimolar concentrations in rat liver microsomes (IC50 = 20.8 and 24.0 microM respectively).
 <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> demonstrated selective inhibition of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> hydroxylation in human liver microsomes but failed to inhibit this reaction in rat liver microsomes.
DDC demonstrated a low level of selectivity as an inhibitory probe for <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1-mediated).
DDC also inhibitedtestosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A-mediated) in man and rat, and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> 4-hydroxylase activity in rat.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was a very potent, selective inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in human liver (IC50 = 0.04 microM).
Oxidation of histamine H1 antagonist <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2D6 in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> [10-(3-quinuclidinylmethyl) phenothiazine] is a long-acting and selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist that is mainly biotransformed by human liver microsomes to yield hydroxylated and S-oxidized metabolites.
Lineweaver-Burk plots for the hydroxylation and the S-oxidation indicated that the hydroxylation occurred with a low Km (0.72 +/- .26 microM) in human liver microsomes.
Microsomes from genetically engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) efficiently metabolizedmequitazine to the hydroxylated and S-oxidized metabolites.
The results indicate that CYP2D6 isozyme is a major form of CYP responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> hydroxylase was inhibited by <START:DRUG> propranolol <END> and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
Inhibition of CYP3A-catalyzedmidazolam 1'-hydroxylase by various histamine H1 antagonists, including <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> , suggested that <START:DRUG> mequitazine <END> and some other histamine H1 antagonists could also be inhibitors of CYP3A in human liver microsomes.
The In vitro hepatic metabolism of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in mice, rats and dogs: comparison with human liver microsomes.
The major metabolic pathway of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in the human has been shown to be 3-hydroxylation mediated mainly by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
In this extended in vitro study, <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylation was further investigated using microsomes from mouse, rat, dog and human livers and was compared among them in terms of the in vitro enzyme-kinetic parameters and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> -drug interaction screenings.
In all species, 3-hydroxyquinine was the principal metabolite of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> .
There was intra- and interspecies variability among all the kinetic parameters, and dogs exhibited a closer resemblance to humans in terms of the mean kinetic data.
Both <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> and <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> showed an interspecies difference in <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylation: a trend toward an activation in dog and human, and a significant inhibition in mouse and rat, liver microsomes.
Antisera raised against rat CYP3A2 strongly inhibitedquinine 3-hydroxylation by about 96, 84 and 92% with mouse, rat and dog liver microsomes, respectively, but neither anti-rat 2C11 and 2E1 antisera did so with rat liver microsomes.
There was a significantcorrelation (r = 0.986, P < .001) between the CYP3A contents and the formation rates of 3-hydroxyquinine in eight human liver microsomal samples.
It is concluded that 3-hydroxyquinine is a main metabolite of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> and that CYP3A/Cyp3a is a principal isoform involved in this metabolic pathway in the respective (rat, dog and human/mouse) species tested.
The dog and possibly the rat may be qualitatively and quantitatively suitable animal models for exploring the <START:DRUG> quinine <END> 3-hydroxylase activity and for screening <START:DRUG> quinine <END> -drug interactions in vitro, at certain inconsistency with the human liver microsomal data.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> inhibited the 3-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> quinine <END> in all species.
 <START:DRUG> primaquine <END> , <START:DRUG> doxycycline <END> and <START:DRUG> tetracycline <END> substantially inhibited the formation of 3-hydroxyquinine in rat, dog and human species, but <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> had no such effect in any species.
 <START:DRUG> chloroquine <END> inhibitedquinine 3-hydroxylation with rat and dog liver microsomes but not with human liver microsomes.
Inhibition of CYP2C9 by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in vitro: studies of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> p-hydroxylation.
Inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has frequently been reported with regard to pathways mediated by CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, and CYP1A2.
little data exist on the capability of SSRIs to inhibitCYP2C9.
We investigated the effect of SSRIs on p-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> (PPH), an established index reaction reflecting CYP2C9 activity, in an in vitro assay using liver tissue from six different human donors.
In control incubations (without inhibitor), 5-(p-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH) formation rates were: Vmax0.023 nmol min(-1) mg(-1); Km14.3 microM.
These findings are consistent with published case reports describing SSRI-related increments in plasma <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> levels.
Because <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> has a narrow therapeutic index, plasma levels should be closely monitored when SSRIs are coadministered.
Average inhibition constants (Ki) differed significantly among the SSRIs, with <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> having the lowest Ki (6 microM) followed by R- <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (13 microM), <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> (17 microM), RS- <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (19 microM), <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> (33 microM), <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> (35 microM), S- <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> (62 microM), and <START:DRUG> desmethylsertraline <END> (66 microM).
Thus, assuming comparable molar concentrations at the site of inhibition, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> can be expected to have the highest probability of interfering with the metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates.
S- <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> is on average a 5 fold weaker CYP2C9 inhibitor than either R- <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> or the racemic mixture.
Both cytochromes P450 2E1 and 3A are involved in the O-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> , a catalytic activity known to be specific for P450 2E1.
4-Nitrophenol 2-hydroxylation activity was previously shown to be mainly catalyzed by P450 2E1 in animal species and humans.
As this chemical compound is widely used as an in vitro probe for P450 2E1, this study was carried out to test its catalytic specificity.
First, experiments were carried out on liver microsomes and hepatocyte cultures of rat treated with different inducers.
Liver microsomes from pyrazole- and <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> -treated rats hydroxylated <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> with a metabolic rate increased by 2.5- and 2.7-fold vs control.
Hepatocyte cultures from <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> -treated rats transformed <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> into 4-nitrocatechol 7.8 times more than controls.
This catalytic activity was inhibited by TAO.
Similarly, hepatocyte cultures from pyrazole-treated rats hydroxylated <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> with a metabolic ratio increased by about 8-fold vs control.
This reaction was inhibited by diethyl dithiocarbamate and dimethyl sulfoxide, both inhibitors of P450 2E1.
Second, the capability of human P450s other than P450 2E1 to catalyze the formation of 4-nitrocatechol was examined in a panel of 13 human liver microsomes.
Finally, the use of human cell lines genetically engineered for expression of human P450s demonstrated that P450 2E1 and 3A4 hydroxylated 4-nitrophenol with turnovers of 19.5 and 1.65 min-1, respectively.
In conclusion, P450 3Amay make a significant contribution to 4-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity in man and rat.
 <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> treatment increased the hepatic content of P450 3A but not that of P450 2E1.
Two specific inhibitors of P450 3A catalytic activities, namely, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (TAO), inhibited up to 50% of 4-nitrophenol hydroxylation in <START:DRUG> dexamethasone <END> -treated rats but not in controls.
Diethyl dithiocarbamate and ketoconazolereduced 4-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity by 77% (+/- 11) and 13% (+/- 16), respectively.
Furthermore, the residual activity following diethyl dithiocarbamate inhibition was significantlycorrelated with seven P450 3A4 catalytic activities.
Formation of <START:DRUG> guanoxabenz <END> from <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> in human liver.
A new metabolic marker for CYP1A2.
The in vitro N-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> as well as the corresponding N-dehydroxylation of <START:DRUG> guanoxabenz <END> has been previously detected in biotransformation studies with microsomal fractions of different species including human hepatic microsomes.
Furthermore, the N-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> was found to be catalyzed by enriched cytochrome P450 (P450) fractions in reconstituted systems.
Strong correlations between 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation (r = 0.96; p < 0.001), <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> N-demethylation (r = 0.92; p < 0.001), respectively, and <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> N-hydroxylation activities were demonstrated in 10 human liver microsomal preparations.
Studies with microsomes from human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing human cytochrome P450 enzymes proved that CYP1A2 is the major isozyme responsible for this metabolic pathway.
Further, P450 isozymes did not show any detectable conversion rates.
The N-reduction of <START:DRUG> guanoxabenz <END> to <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> exhibits a significantcorrelation to the benzamidoxime N-reduction after incubation with 10 human liver microsomal preparations (r = 0.97; p < 0.001).
The formation of <START:DRUG> benzamidine <END> from benzamidoxime was described previously to be catalyzed by the benzamidoxime reductase.
These results suggest that the <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> N-hydroxylation is mediated via CYP1A2, whereas the corresponding <START:DRUG> guanoxabenz <END> N-reduction is catalyzed by an enzyme system composed of cytochrome b5, NADH cytochrome b5-reductase, and benzamidoxime reductase.
The high affinity of <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> to CYP1A2 and the distinct selectivity of this P450 isozyme toward <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> confirms the in vitro <START:DRUG> guanabenz <END> N-hydroxylation to be a suitable metabolic marker for CYP1A2 in biotransformation studies.
The reaction was inhibited in presence of the potent CYP1A2inhibitors <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> (7, 8-benzoflavone) and <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> .
 <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> hydroxylation by cytochromes P450 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 in human liver microsomes.
Roles of human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 in the oxidation of <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> were studied in recombinant P450 enzymes and in human liver microsomes.
In vitro inhibition experiments showed that <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> and its 17alpha- and 21-hydroxylated metabolites and 11-deoxycortisol suppressed the CYP2C19-dependent R- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> 7-hydroxylation activities, with <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> being the most active.
These steroid chemicals also inhibitedCYP2C9-dependent S- <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> 7-hydroxylation activities though lesser extents seen with those in CYP2C19 enzyme.
Recombinant CYP2C19catalyzedprogesterone to form 21-hydroxyprogesterone as a major product and 16alpha- and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone as minor products.
CYP2C9 also had <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> 21-hydroxylation activities, although the activities were lower than those catalyzed by CYP2C19.
Vmax/Km ratios for the <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> 21-hydroxylation activity of CYP2C19 were determined to be 13- and 32-foldhigher than those of CYP2C9 and 3A4, respectively.
CYP3A4 oxidized <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> to form 16alpha-, 6beta-, and 2beta-hydroxyprogesterone as major products and 21-hydroxyprogesterone as a minor product, but did not produce detectable levels of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone.
CYP2C19 was also found to oxidize <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> at 17-position to form androstenedione.
These results suggest that CYP2C19 plays important roles in the oxidation of <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> in human liver microsomes, although the physiological significance of these metabolic pathways remains unclear.
CYP2C9may have some, but lesser extent than those by CYP2C19, of the catalytic roles for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> by human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> was found to be a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 in human liver microsomes.
Immunoinhibition experiments suggested that anti-CYP2C9 (which inhibits both CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 catalytic activities) suppressed the <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> 21-hydroxylation activities catalyzed by liver microsomes of humans and monkeys and that anti-CYP2C11 inhibited the <START:DRUG> progesterone <END> 21-hydroxylation activities catalyzed by liver microsomes of male rats.
Androstenedione formationcatalyzed by liver microsomes of humans and monkeys and of male rats was suppressed by anti-CYP2C9 and anti-CYP2C11, respectively.
Differential inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms by the protease inhibitors, <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> , <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> .
To compare the inhibitory potential of the HIV protease inhibitorssaquinavir, <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> and <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> against CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 catalysed metabolic reactions in human liver microsomes in vitro.
Microsomes from six human livers were utilized in this study.
The probe substrates were <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> (CYP1A2), <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (CYP2E1) and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> (CYP3A4).
Metabolites were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography.
IC50 (concentration of inhibitor giving 50%decrease in enzyme activity) and, where appropriate, K(i) values were calculated.
The HIV protease inhibitors have differential effects on CYP isozymes.
There is obvious potential for clinically significant drug interactions particularly with <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> .
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are crucial to gain an overall understanding of the beneficial and potentially harmful effects of this important group of drugs.
 <START:DRUG> ritonavir <END> was a very potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 mediated <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (mean K(i) = 0.019 +/- 0.004 microM, mean +/- s.d.; n = 6 ) and also inhibitedtolbutamide hydroxylation (IC50 = 4.2 +/- 1.3 microM, mean +/- s.d.; n = 6).
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation and <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation was negligible.
 <START:DRUG> indinavir <END> was an order-of-magnitude less potent in inhibiting CYP3A4 (K(i) = 0.17 +/- 0.01 microM) and did not produce appreciable inhibition of the CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP2E1 catalysed reactions.
 <START:DRUG> saquinavir <END> was the least potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (K(i) = 2.99 +/- 0.87 microM) and produced some inhibition of CYP2C9 (approximately 50% at 50 microM).
Applications of primary human hepatocytes in the evaluation of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions: evaluation of model drugs <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> .
The utility of primary human hepatocytes in the evaluation of drug-drug interactions is being investigated in our laboratories.
Our initial approach was to investigate whether drug-drug interactions observed in humans in vivo could be reproduced in vitro using human hepatocytes.
Two model drugs were studied: <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> and <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> , representing compounds subjected to drug-drug interactions via inhibitory and induction mechanisms, respectively.
 <START:DRUG> terfenadine <END> was found to be metabolized by human hepatocytes to C-oxidation and N-dealkylation products as observed in humans in vivo.
Metabolism by human hepatocytes was found to be inhibited by drugs which are known to be inhibitory in vivo.
The induction effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> was observed in hepatocytes isolated from all 7 human donors studied, with ages ranging from 1.7 to 78 years.
To demonstrate that the <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> -induction of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation could be generalized to other CYP3A4 substrates, we evaluated the metabolism of another known substrate of CYP3A4, <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> .
Dose-dependent induction of <START:DRUG> lidocaine <END> metabolism by <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> is observed.
Our results suggest that primary human hepatocytes may be a useful experimental system for preclinical evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential during drug development, and as a tool to evaluate the mechanism of clinically observed drug-drug interactions.
Ki values for the various inhibitors were derived from the in vitro metabolism data, resulting in the following ranking of inhibitory potency: For the inhibition of C-oxidation, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> > <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> > <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> approximately <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> > <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> > <START:DRUG> naringenin <END> .
For the inhibition of N-dealkylation, <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> > or = <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> > <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> > or = <START:DRUG> naringenin <END> > or = <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> > or = <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> induction of CYP3A, a known effect of <START:DRUG> rifampin <END> in vivo, was also reproduced in primary human hepatocytes.
Induction of CYP3A4, measured as <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation, was found to be dose-dependent, treatment duration-dependent, and reversible.
Evaluation of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> as inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isoforms.
The human clearance of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> is conducted primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system.
Efficacy data indicate few differences between these two drugs, but they may exhibit discrete drug interaction profiles.
To compare the potency and specificity of these drugs as inhibitors of CYP isoforms, we performed in vitro studies with human liver microsomal preparations.
Our data suggest that whereas the inhibitory profiles of these two drugs are similar, lansoprazolemay be the more important in vitro inhibitor of CYP2D6.
Since its inhibition is very potent and has a broad \"window of selectivity,\" <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> seems to be a useful, selective inhibitor of CYP2C19.
Both drugs were potent, competitive inhibitors of CYP2C19, as measured by the conversion of S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> to 4-hydroxymephenytoin (k(i) = 3.1 +/- 2.2 microM for <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , K(i) = 3.2 +/- 1.3 microM for <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> ).
For <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , the highest concentration at which >70% inhibition of CYP2C19 was observed with nosignificant inhibitory effect on other isoforms was at least 20 times greater than K(i).
Both drugs were competitive inhibitors of CYP2C9-catalyzed conversion of <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> to 4-hydroxytolbutamide (K(i) = 40.1 +/- 14.8 microM for <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , K(i) = 52.1 +/- 1.4 microM for <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> ) and were noncompetitive inhibitors of CYP3A-catalyzed conversion of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> to 3-methoxymorphinan (K(i) = 84.4 +/- 4.0 microM for <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , K(i) = 170.4 +/- 7.1 microM for <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> ).
 <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> was at least 5 times more potent (K(i) = 44.7 +/- 22.0 microM) than <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (k(i) = 240.7 +/- 102.0 microM) as an inhibitor of CYP2D6-mediated conversion of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> to <START:DRUG> dextrorphan <END> .
Noinhibition of CYP1A2, assessed by measuring the conversion of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> to <START:DRUG> acetaminophen <END> , was noted.
Inhibition of human drug metabolizing cytochromes P450 by <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> , a potent and selective inhibitor of aromatase.
 <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> (2,2' [5(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-phenylene]- bis(2-methylproprionitrile)) is a potent third-generation inhibitor of aromatase, currently marketed as a treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.
While its potency and selectivity for inhibition of <START:DRUG> estrogen <END> synthesis has been established in both preclinical and clinical studies, this study used in vitro methods to examine the effects of <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> on several drug metabolizing CYP enzymes found in human liver.
Human liver microsomes were co-incubated with <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> and probe substrates for CYP1A2 ( <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> ), CYP2A6 ( <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> ), CYP2C9 ( <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> ), CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> ), and CYP3A ( <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> ).
The formation of the CYP-specific metabolites following co-incubation with various <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> concentrations was determined to establish IC50 and Ki values for these enzymes.
Dixon plots used to determine the Ki values for the inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP3A activities by <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> were biphasic, indicating additional lower affinity Ki values.
While <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> did not inhibitCYP2A6 and CYP2D6 activities at concentrations below 500 microM, this compound inhibitedCYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A activities with Ki values of 8, 10, and 10 microM, respectively.
Major metabolites of <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> did not retain the ability to inhibit the metabolism of <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> (CYP3A).
The results of this study indicate that, although <START:DRUG> anastrozole <END> can inhibitCYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A-mediated catalytic activities, this compound would not be expected to cause clinically significant interactions with other CYP-metabolized drugs at physiologically relevant concentrations achieved during therapy with <START:DRUG> arimidex <END> (Zeneca, Ltd., Macclesfield, UK) 1-mg.
Inhibition of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes.
Nine organic solvents and 47 commonly used P450 substrates and inhibitors were examined for their effects on <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylase (CYP2A6) activity in human liver microsomes.
Of the nine organic solvents examined (final concentration 1%, v/v), only methanol did not inhibit the 7-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> (0.5 to 50 microM) by human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> dioxane <END> and tetra-hydrofuran, which are structurally related to <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> , were the most inhibitory solvents examined.
Although the rates of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation varied enormously among nine samples of human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYP2A6 (Vmax = 179 to 2470 pmol/ mg protein/min), the Km for <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylation was fairly constant (ranging from 0.50 to 0.70 microM).
In other words, these chemicals, at a final concentration of 100 microM, failed to inhibitCYP2A6 when the concentration of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> was equal to Km (0.50 microM).
The potency with which each chemical inhibited the 7-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> was independent of which sample of human liver microsomes was studied.
With the exception of <START:DRUG> 8-methoxypsoralen <END> , preincubation of human liver microsomes and NADPH with the aforementioned inhibitors did not increase their ability to inhibitCYP2A6.
The results of this study underscore the need for a systematic evaluation of the specificity of commonly used P450 inhibitors.
The following chemicals caused little or noinhibition of CYP2A6 as defined by a Ki> 200 microM: <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> , <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> , <START:DRUG> diazepam <END> , <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> ethinylestradiol <END> , <START:DRUG> ethynyltestosterone <END> , <START:DRUG> fluconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> furfural <END> , <START:DRUG> hexobarbital <END> , <START:DRUG> itraconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , <START:DRUG> methimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> metronidazole <END> , <START:DRUG> naringenin <END> , <START:DRUG> naringin <END> , <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> , <START:DRUG> norfloxacin <END> , <START:DRUG> norgestrel <END> , <START:DRUG> orphenadrine <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , <START:DRUG> papaverine <END> , <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> , <START:DRUG> pyrimethamine <END> , <START:DRUG> ranitidine <END> , <START:DRUG> spironolactone <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfinpyrazone <END> , <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> , <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> warfarin <END> .
The following chemicals were classified as strong inhibitors of CYP2A6 (defined by Ki< 200 microM): <START:DRUG> clotrimazole <END> , <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , <START:DRUG> ellipticine <END> , <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> 8-methoxypsoralen <END> , <START:DRUG> 4-methylpyrazole <END> , <START:DRUG> metyrapone <END> , <START:DRUG> miconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> nicotine <END> , <START:DRUG> p-nitrophenol <END> , and <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> .
One of the most potent inhibitors of <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> 7-hydroxylase was <START:DRUG> 8-methoxypsoralen <END> ( <START:DRUG> methoxsalen <END> ), which was determined to be a mechanism-based inhibitor (suicide substrate) of CYP2A6(k(inactivation)0.5 min-1).
The most potent competitive inhibitor of CYP2A6 was <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> (Ki = 0.04 microM).
Several of the chemicals that strongly inhibitedCYP2A6, such as <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> tranylcypromine <END> , are often used with the intention of selectively inhibiting human P450 enzymes other than CYP2A6.
Human cytochrome P450 3A4-catalyzedtestosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> N-demethylation.
Competition during catalysis.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 is known to catalyze the metabolism of both endogenous substrates (such as the 6 beta-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> ) and many important therapeutic agents, including the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> .
However, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> have been reported to have little or no effect on the metabolism of each other by recombinant CYP3A4.
In an effort to understand the basis of these observations, we studied the N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> and the 6 beta-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> in human liver microsomes and in microsomes from cells containing recombinant human CYP3A4 and P450 reductase under a variety of experimental conditions.
However, the inhibition mechanism was complex.
When the rates of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> N-demethylation were determined in microsomal incubations containing both substrates at lower concentrations, the observed rates for each reaction were in good agreement with the calculated rates based on the rate equation describing simultaneous metabolism of two substrates by a single enzyme.
However, at high substrate concentrations, the kinetic results could be best explained by a mechanism involving partial competitive inhibition.
In both human liver microsomal and recombinant CYP3A4 systems, <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> inhibitedtestosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation in a concentration dependent manner, and vice versa.
At low substrate concentrations, <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> acted as competitive inhibitors to each other.
Under these experimental conditions, an apparent competitive inhibition of <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation by <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> was observed, with Ki values similar to that of the K(m) values for <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> .
We conclude from these studies that <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> mutually inhibit the metabolism of each other, consistent with the fact that CYP 3A4 catalyzes the metabolism of both substrates.
Cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal catalyst of human oxidative halothanemetabolism in vitro.
The volatile anesthetic <START:DRUG> halothane <END> undergoes substantial biotransformation generating metabolites that mediate hepatotoxicity.
Aerobically, <START:DRUG> halothane <END> undergoes cytochrome P450-catalyzedoxidation to <START:DRUG> trifluoroacetic acid <END> (TFA), bromide and a reactive intermediate that can acetylate liver proteins.
These protein neo-antigens stimulate an immune reaction that mediates severe hepatic necrosis (\" <START:DRUG> halothane <END> hepatitis\").
This investigation identified the human P450 isoform(s) that catalyze oxidative halothanemetabolism.
Halothaneoxidation by human liver microsomes was assessed by TFA and bromide formation.
Eadie-Hofstee plots of TFA and bromide formation were both nonlinear, suggesting the participation of multiple P450s.
Conversely, at subsaturating <START:DRUG> halothane <END> concentrations (0.30 vol%), metabolism by P450 2E1 exceeded that by P450 2A6.
Among a panel of human liver microsomes, there were significant linear correlations between halothaneoxidation and P450 2A6 activity and protein content at saturating <START:DRUG> halothane <END> concentrations (2.4 vol%), and a significantcorrelation between metabolite formation and P450 2E1 activity (but not P450 2A6 activity) at subsaturating concentrations (0.12 vol%).
These experiments suggested P450 2A6 and 2E1 as the predominant catalysts at saturating and subsaturating <START:DRUG> halothane <END> concentrations, respectively.
Further kinetic analysis using cDNA-expressed P450 and liver microsomes clearly demonstrated that P450 2E1 is the high affinity/low capacity isoform (Km = 0.030-0.053 vol%) and P450 2A6 is the low affinity/high capacity isoform (Km = 0.77-1.2 vol%).
Evidence was also obtained for substrate inhibition of P450 2E1.
The in vitro clearance estimates (Vmax/Km) for microsomal P450 2E1 (4.3-5.7 ml/min/g) were substantially greater than those for microsomal P450 2A6 (0.12-0.21).
These clearances, as well as rates of apparent halothaneoxidation predicted from kinetic parameters in conjunction with plasma <START:DRUG> halothane <END> concentrations measured during clinical anesthesia in humans, demonstrated that both P450 2E1 and P450 2A6 participate in human halothanemetabolism, and that P450 2E1 is the predominant catalytic isoform.
Microsomal TFA and bromide formation were inhibited45 to 66% and 21 to 26%, respectively, by the P450 2A6 inhibitors8-methoxypsoralen and <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> , 84 to 90% by the P450 2E1inhibitor4-methylpyrazole and 55% by <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , an inhibitor of both P450 2A6 and 2E1.
Selective inhibitors of P450s 1A, 2B6, 2C9/10, 2D6 and 3A4 did not affect halothaneoxidation.
At saturating <START:DRUG> halothane <END> concentrations (2.4 vol%) only cDNA-expressed P450 2A6 and 2B6catalyzedsignificant rates of TFA and bromide formation, and P450 2E1catalyzed comparatively minimal oxidation.
Distinction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 activity by selective inhibition using <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> and <START:DRUG> isosafrole <END> .
 <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylation (EROD) has been used as a specific probe for CYP1A1 and CYP1A2.
Selective inhibition of one of these cytochromes P450 may differentiate their activity in human liver.
Four inhibitors were chosen to examine the selective inhibition of EROD activity, using cDNA of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2.
The two flavones, <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> and apigenin, while differing in potency, inhibited expressed human CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and human liver microsomes to a similar extent.
A set of equations was developed to estimate both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 activity.
Levels of CYP1A2 in four human liver specimens ranged from 44.4 to 76.7 pmol/mg protein, which significantlycorrelated with <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity (r = 0.99; P < 0.001).
Low levels of CYP1A1 activity were present in all four investigated livers, ranging from 0.4 to 2.7 pmol/mg protein.
 <START:DRUG> isosafrole <END> and <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> were found to inhibitCYP1A2 selectively, with Ki values of 14 and 800 times, respectively, lower than those for CYP1A1.
Biotransformation of parathion in human liver: participation of CYP3A4 and its inactivation during microsomal parathion oxidation.
Studies in rat liver have shown that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes mediate the oxidative biotransformation of the phosphorothioate pesticide parathion to paraoxon and 4-nitrophenol.
Transfer of the phosphorothioate thionosulfur atom to the CYP apoprotein results in amino acid modification and enzyme inactivation.
Our study investigated the role of human hepatic CYP in parathion oxidation and their relative susceptibilities to inhibition and inactivation.
Rates of parathion oxidation varied about 10-fold in microsomes from 23 individual livers (1.72-18.33 nmol total metabolites/mg protein/min).
Linear regression of rates of parathion oxidation with those of other microsomal CYP reactions implicated CYP3A4 in the reaction.
Thus, parathion oxidation was correlated strongly with <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (r2 = 0.95, n = 11), but not with activities mediated by CYP 1A2, 2C9 or 2E1.
CYP 3A4 expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines was an efficient catalyst of parathion oxidation, although CYP 1A2 and 2B6 also catalyzed the activity.
The CYP3A4 inhibitorsketoconazole and <START:DRUG> triacetyloleandomycin <END> decreased the observed rate of microsomal parathion oxidation, but chemicals known to interact preferentially with other human CYP were essentially non inhibitory.
P450 was lost during parathion biotransformation in human hepatic microsomes.
Thus, incubation (10 min) of parathion (25 microM) with NADPH-supplemented microsomes led to an apparent 19 +/- 4%decrease in holo-P450 content.
Several CYP-specific oxidation reactions were inhibited and inactivated by parathion.
 <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation (mediated by CYP3A4), 7-ethylresorufin O-deethylation (CYP1A2) and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> methyl hydroxylation (CYP2C9/10), but not aniline 4-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), were inhibited effectively by parathion.
Preincubation of microsomes with parathion and NADPH intensified the extent of inhibition (i.e., elicited inactivation) of reactions mediated by 3A4 and 1A2 and, to a lesser extent, 2C9.
In summary, these findings strongly implicate CYP 3A4 as the principal catalyst of parathion oxidation in human liver, although other CYP may play a lesser role.
During parathion oxidationCYP3A4 undergoes significantinactivation.
In view of the role of this enzyme in the oxidation of many therapeutic agents, exposure to phosphorothioate pesticides may adversely affect drug elimination in humans.

Identification of cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> N-demethylation by human liver microsomes.
Studies to assess the enzyme kinetic behavior and to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform(s) involved in the major metabolic pathway (N-demethylation) for <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> (CIT), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, were performed using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoforms.
The N-demethylation activities showed significant correlations with the alpha- and 4-hydroxylation activities of <START:DRUG> triazolam <END> (r(s) = 0.818 and 0.851, respectively; P < .01) in 10 different human liver microsomes.
In addition, there was a significantcorrelation between CIT N-demethylation and (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation (r(s) = 0.773, P < .05), although little inhibition was observed in the presence of anti-CYP2C antibodies or (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> .
The percentage contributions of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 to the overall N-demethylation of CIT in human liver microsomes were estimated using a relative activity factor; respective values of 70% and 7% were calculated for microsomes obtained from livers from putative extensive metabolizers for (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation.
These results suggest that CYP3A4 is the major isoenzyme and CYP2C19 is the minor form involved in the major metabolic pathway for CIT in human liver microsomes.
Anti-CYP3A antibodies and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> strongly inhibitedCIT N-demethylation.
cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 and CYP2C19catalyzedCIT N-demethylation, whereas no appreciable activities were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1.
Inhibition by <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> of <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> metabolism: mechanism of the interaction in vitro and prediction of in vivo results from the in vitro experiments.
Both the antimalarial prodrug <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> and the gastric proton pump inhibitoromeprazole are substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 and CYP3A.
However, the relative contribution of each enzyme to <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> bioactivation to <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> and to the metabolism of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> , as well as their potential to interact, remains to be examined.
The bioactivation of <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> to its active metabolite <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> was studied in vitro in human liver microsomes and in vivo in 12 healthy subjects, in the absence and in the presence of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> .
The formation of <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> from <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> exhibited biphasic kinetic behavior in four of six human livers, indicating that at least two enzymes are responsible for this metabolic step.
 <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formation activity did not correlate with immunoreactive CYP3A4 content or with CYP3A4 activity, as measured by <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation, suggesting that CYP3A4 plays a limited role in <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formation.
We conclude that in vitro studies of proguanilmetabolism and interactions are predictive of in vivo situations, that CYP2C19 is the main enzyme responsible for <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> bioactivation to <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> and that <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> inhibits this biotransformation in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting this enzyme.
Furthermore, <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (10 microM) inhibited only 10 to 17% of <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formation at <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> concentrations of 100 and 500 microM.
At a <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> concentration of 20 microM, <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> at 10 microM inhibited <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> formation in vitro by 47 +/- 59%.
These in vitro results were consistent with the results of our in vivo study in healthy subjects, which showed a 32 +/- 11%decrease in <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> apparent oral clearance and a 65 +/- 8%decrease in <START:DRUG> proguanil <END> partial metabolic clearance to <START:DRUG> cycloguanil <END> in the presence of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (both P < .001).
Variable contribution of cytochromes P450 2D6, 2C9 and 3A4 to the 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> by human liver microsomes.
4-Hydroxylation is an important pathway of tamoxifenmetabolism because the product of this reaction is intrinsically 100 times more potent as an <START:DRUG> oestrogen <END> receptor antagonist than is the parent drug.
Although <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> 4-hydroxylation is catalysed by human cytochrome P450 (CYP), data conflict on the specific isoforms responsible.
The aim of this study was to define unequivocally the role of individual CYPs in the 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> by human liver microsomes.
Microsomes from each of 10 human livers catalysed the reaction [range = 0.6-2.9 pmol/mg protein/min (1 microM substrate concentration) and 6-25 pmol/mg protein/min (18 microM)].
Three of the livers with the lowest <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> 4-hydroxylation activity were from genetically poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6.
Recombinant human CYPs 2D6, 2C9 and 3A4 but not CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2C19 and 2E1 displayed significant 4-hydroxylation activity.
However, the marked between-subject variation in the contribution of these isoforms underlines the need to study metabolic reactions in a sufficient number of livers that are characterised with respect to a range of cytochrome P450 activities.
Inhibition of activity by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (1 microM), <START:DRUG> sulphaphenazole <END> (20 microM) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (2 microM), selective inhibitors of CYPs 2D6, 2C9 and 3A4, respectively, was 0-80%, 0-80% and 12-57%.
The proportion of activity inhibited by quinidinecorrelated positively with total microsomal <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> 4-hydroxylation activity (rs = 0.89, P < 0.01), indicating a major involvement of CYP2D6 in this reaction.
Similar inhibition and correlation experiments confirmed that <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> N-demethylation is catalysed predominantly by CYP3A4.
These findings indicate that the 4-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> tamoxifen <END> is catalysed almost exclusively by CYPs 2D6, 2C9 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes.
Aryl acetylenes as mechanism-based inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase enzymes.
Aryl acetylenes have been investigated as inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent alkoxyresorufin dealkylation dealkylation activities in liver microsomes prepared from rats exposed to <START:DRUG> beta-naphthoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> isosafrole <END> , or <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> .
Many of the acetylenes investigated produce pseudo-first-order time-dependent and NADPH-dependent losses of the dealkylation activities characteristic of mechanism-based irreversible inactivation (suicide inhibition).
Replacing the terminal hydrogen of aryl acetylenes with a methyl group to convert ethynes into propynes enhances the inhibition of P450 1A enzymes; in some instances, this modification converts a reversible inhibitor of P450s into a suicide inhibitor.
In contrast, ethynes are more effective suicide inhibitors of P450 2B-dependent dealkylations than the corresponding propynes.
Aryl acetylenes with an ethynyl group on the 2 position of naphthalene or on the 9 position of phenanthrene and arylalkyl acetylenes with alkyl chains containing 2, 3, or 4 methylene groups are selective inhibitors of P450 2B1/2B2 in liver microsomes from rats.
In agreement with previous reports [Yun, C.-H., Hammons, G. J., Jones, G., Martin, M. V., Hopkins, N. E., Alworth, W. L., and Guengerich, F. P. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 10556-10563],"
In the systems examined, the losses of P450-dependent activity produced by these aryl acetylenes were not accompanied by corresponding decreases in the measured P450 absorption spectra.
Thus P450 inactivation by these aryl acetylenes does not involve labeling and destruction of the <START:DRUG> heme <END> .
Incubation of 4PBi with microsomal P450 1A1 or 1A2 from rat liver under conditions that lead to P450-dependent, enzyme inactivations generates a 2-biphenylylpropionic acid product.
This suggests that the suicide inhibition of P450s by propynylaryl acetylenes proceeds via a methylaryl ketene formed by a 1,2-methyl rearrangement, analogous to the mechanism of suicide inhibition by ethynyl acetylenes that proceed via ketene intermediates formed by 1,2-hydrogen shifts [Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., and Kunze, K. L.(1981) Arch.

Aryl acetylenes also act as suicide inhibitors of P450 1A2 in human liver microsomes, of purified P450 1A2 from rabbit or rat liver in reconstituted systems, and of purified recombinant human P450 1A2 and 1A1 in reconstituted systems.
4-(1-Propynyl)biphenyl (4PBi) inactivated P450 1A2-dependent ethoxyresourfin deethylation (EROD) activity in human liver microsomes in an NADPH-dependent process (k(inactivation), 0.23 min-1; KI, 2.3 microM).
4PBi also inactivated purified recombinant human P450 1A2 (k(inactivation), 0.24 min-1; KI, 4.3 microM).
2-ethynylnaphthalene (2EN) was not a suicide inhibitor of the P450 1A2 activity in human liver microsomes but did inactivate purified human P450 1A2.
Neither 4PBi nor 2EN affected diagnostic activities of human microsomal P450 2E1, 2C9/10, 3A4, or 2C19.
 <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation by human liver microsomes in vitro: inhibition by chemical probes, SSRI antidepressants, <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> and <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> .
Biotransformation of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> via O-deethylation to <START:DRUG> acetaminophen <END> , an index reaction reflecting activity of Cytochrome P450-1A2, was studied in microsomal preparations from a series of human livers.
Acetaminophenformation was consistent with a double Michaelis-Menten system, with low-Km (mean Km1 = 68 microM) and high-Km (mean Km2 = 7691 microM) components.
The low-K(m) enzyme accounted for an average of 96% of estimated ntrinsic clearancei, and was predicted to contribute more than 50% of net reaction velocity at <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> concentrations less than 2000 microM.
The other SSRIs were more than tenfold less potent.
The antidepressant <START:DRUG> nefazodone <END> and four of its metabolites (meta-chloro-phenylpiperazine, two hydroxylated derivatives, and a triazoledione) were very weak inhibitors of P450-1A2.
 <START:DRUG> venlafaxine <END> and its O- and <START:DRUG> n-desmethyl <END> metabolites showed minimal inhibitory activity.
Among index inhibitor probes, <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> was a highly potent inhibitor of the low-Km enzyme (Ki1 = 0.013 microM); <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> also was a moderately active inhibitor (Ki1 = 4.4 microM), but its inhibiting potency was increased by preincubation with microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was a relatively weakinhibitor (Ki1 = 32 microM); <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> cimetidine <END> showed minimal inhibiting activity.
Among six selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> was a potent inhibitor of 1A2 (mean Ki1 = 0.24 microM).
Mean Ki1 values were: <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , 4.4 microM; <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> , 15.9 microM; <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> , <START:DRUG> 8.8 microM <END> ; <START:DRUG> desmethylsertraline <END> , 9.5 microM; <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , 5.5 microM.
CYP2D6 is the principal cytochrome P450 responsible for metabolism of the histamine H1 antagonist <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> in human liver microsomes.
To determine which cytochrome P450 form is involved in the <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> [10-(2-dimethylaminopropyl) phenothiazine] metabolism, in vitro analysis using human liver microsomes were performed.
 <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> was mainly biotransformed to ring-hydroxylated, S-oxidized and N-demethylated metabolites.
Lineweaver-Burk plots for the hydroxylation, S-oxidation and N-demethylation indicated that the hydroxylation occurred with a low K(m) value in human liver microsomes.
Microsomes from genetically-engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6 hydroxylated <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> most efficiently as compared to other P450 forms, indicating that it was the principal P450 responsible for the metabolism of <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> in human liver microsomes.
The <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> hydroxylase in human liver microsomes was inhibited by <START:DRUG> sKF-525A <END> , <START:DRUG> propranolol <END> , <START:DRUG> sparteine <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and anti-CYP2D6 serum suggesting involvement of a P450 related to CYP2D6.
The inhibition of CYP2D6-catalysed <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylase by various histamine H3 antagonists including <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> suggested that <START:DRUG> promethazine <END> and some other histamine H1 antagonists could be inhibitors of this P450 in human liver microsomes.
Inter-individual variability in the oxidation of 1,2-dibromoethane: use of heterologously expressed human cytochrome P450 and human liver microsomes.
1,2-Dibromoethane (1,2-DBE) is mainly used as an additive in leaded gasoline and as a soil fumigant and it is a suspected carcinogen in humans.
In this study, the oxidative bioactivation of 1,2-DBE to 2-bromoacetaldehyde (2-BA) was studied using heterologously expressed human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoenzymes and human liver microsomes.
Out of ten heterologously expressed human P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5), only human CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2E1metabolized 1,2-DBE, albeit with strongly differing catalytic efficiencies.
The apparent Km and Vmax values were 3.3 mM and 0.17 pmol/min per pmol P450 for CYP2A6, 9.7 mM and 3.18 pmol/min per pmol P450 for CYP2B6 and 42 microM and 1.3 pmol/min per pmol P450 for CYP2E1, respectively.
In all of 21 human liver samples studied, 1,2-DBE was oxidized with activities ranging from 22.2 to 1027.6 pmol/min per mg protein, thus showing a 46-fold inter-individual variability.
The kinetics of the oxidative metabolism of 1,2-DBE to 2-BA in human liver microsomes were linear, indicating the involvement of primarily one single P450 isoenzyme.
There was a tendency towards a positive correlation between the oxidative metabolism of 1,2-DBE in the human liver microsomes and the 6-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> , a selective substrate for CYP2E1.
Furthermore, the oxidative metabolism of 1,2-DBE was inhibited by the specific CYP2E1inhibitorsdisulfiram (DS) and <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> (DDC).
In contrast, a poor correlation was found between the immunochemically quantified amount of CYP2E1 and the microsomal <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> 6-hydroxylation or the 1,2-DBE oxidation.
The results indicate that CYP2E1 is probably the major P450 isoenzyme involved in the oxidative hepatic metabolism of 1,2-DBE in humans.
The inter-individual variability in the oxidative bioactivation of 1,2-DBE in humans, largely due to inter-individual variability in the catalytic activity of hepatic CYP2E1, may have important consequences for the risk assessment for human exposure to 1,2-DBE.

Human reductive <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism in vitro is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2A6 and 3A4.
The anesthetic <START:DRUG> halothane <END> undergoes extensive oxidative and reductive biotransformation, resulting in metabolites that cause hepatotoxicity.
 <START:DRUG> halothane <END> is reduced anaerobically by cytochrome P450 (P450) to the volatile metabolites 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene (CDE) and 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (CTE).
The purpose of this investigation was to identify the human P450 isoform(s) responsible for reductive halothanemetabolism.
CDE and  mation from <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism by human liver microsomes was determined by GC/MS analysis.
Eadie-Hofstee plots of both CDE and CTE formation were nonlinear, suggesting multiple P450 isoform involvement.
This investigation demonstrated that human liver microsomal reductive <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism is catalyzed predominantly by P450 2A6 and 3A4.
This isoform selectivity for anaerobic halothanemetabolism contrasts with that for oxidative human <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism, which is catalyzed predominantly by P450 2E1.
 <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism to CDE and CTE under reductive conditions was completely inhibited by carbon monoxide, which implicates exclusively P450 in this reaction.
Microsomal CDE and CTE formation were each inhibited40-50% by P450 2A6-selective inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> coumarin <END> and <START:DRUG> 8-methoxypsoralen <END> ) and 55-60% by P450 3A4-selective inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> ).
P450 1A-, 2B6-, 2C9/10-, and 2D6-selective inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> 7,8-benzoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> orphenadrine <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ) had no significant effect on reductive <START:DRUG> halothane <END> metabolism.
Measurement of product formationcatalyzed by a panel of cDNA-expressed P450 isoforms revealed that maximal rates of CDEformation occurred with P450 2A6, followed by P450 3A4.
P450 3A4 was the most effective catalyst of CTE formation.
Among a panel of 11 different human livers, there were significant linear correlations between the rate of CDEformation and both 2A6 activity ( r = 0.64, p < 0.04) and 3A4 activity (r = 0.64, p < 0.03).
Similarly, there were significant linear correlations between CTE formation and both 2A6 activity (r = 0.55, p < 0.08) and 3A4 activity (r = 0.77, p < 0.005).
The P450 2E1inhibitors <START:DRUG> 4-methylpyrazole <END> and <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> inhibitedCDE and CTE formation by 20-45% and 40-50%, respectively; however, cDNA-expressed P450 2E1 did not catalyze significant amounts of CDE or CTE production, and microsomal metabolite formation was not correlated with P450 2E1 activity.
Identification of human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in the in vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> (Flexeril) is a muscle relaxant, possessing a tricyclic structure.
Numerous therapeutic agents containing this structure are known to be metabolized by polymorphic cytochrome P4502D6.
The aim of this study was to determine if cytochrome P4502D6 and other isoforms are involved in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> in human liver microsomes.
When a panel of microsomes prepared from human B-lymphoblastoid cells that expressed specific human cytochrome P450 isoforms were used, only microsomes containing cytochromes P4501A2, 2D6, and 3A4catalyzed N-demethylation.
In addition, demethylation catalyzed by these recombinant cytochromes P450 can be completely inhibited with selective inhibitors at concentrations as low as 1 to 20 microM.
To further determine the involvement of cytochrome P4502D6 in cyclobenzaprinemetabolism, liver microsomes from a human that lacked CYP2D6 enzyme activities was included in this study.
The data showed that <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> N-demethylation still occurred in the incubation with this microsome.
These results suggested that cytochrome P4502D6 plays only a minor role in <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> N-demethylation whereas 3A4 and 1A2 are primarily responsible for cyclobenzaprinemetabolism in human liver microsomes.
Due to the minimum involvement of CYP2D6 in the vitro metabolism of <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> , the polymorphism of cytochrome P4502D6 in man should not be of muci concern in the clinical use of <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> .
Selective cytochrome P450 inhibitors for CYP1A1/2 ( <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> and <START:DRUG> 7,8-benzoflavone <END> ) and CYP3A4 ( <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) inhibited the formation of <START:DRUG> desmethylcyclobenzaprine <END> , a major metabolite of <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> , in human liver microsomes.
Antibodies directed against CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A4 inhibited the demethylation reaction whereas anti-human CYP2C9/10, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 antibodies did not show any inhibitory effects.
Interestingly, <START:DRUG> cyclobenzaprine <END> N-demethylation was significantlycorrelated with <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> 3-demethylation (1A2) and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation (3A4) but not with <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (2D6) in human liver microsomes.
Microsomal <START:DRUG> codeine <END> N-demethylation: cosegregation with cytochrome P4503A4 activity.
 <START:DRUG> codeine <END> is metabolized by glucuronidation, by O-demethylation to <START:DRUG> morphine <END> , and by N-demethylation to <START:DRUG> norcodeine <END> .
The enzyme responsible for the O-demethylation to <START:DRUG> morphine <END> has been identified as cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6).
The purpose of the present study was to identify the specific P450 enzyme responsible for <START:DRUG> codeine <END> N-demethylation.
Microsomal preparations (250 pmol of P450) obtained from 12 human liver donors were incubated with 20 microM <START:DRUG> codeine <END> and analyzed for norcodeineformation.
Additionally, significant <START:DRUG> norcodeine <END> production was observed with purified CYP3A4 derived from human liver microsomes.
In conclusion, <START:DRUG> codeine <END> N-demethylation activity cosegregates with CYP3A4 activity.
 <START:DRUG> codeine <END> N-demethylation activity was linearly correlated with <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> oxidation activity (r = 0.90, p < 0.001), a marker of CYP3A4, but not with <START:DRUG> codeine <END> O-demethylation, a marker of CYP2D6.
Preincubation with <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (50 microM), or <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> (50 microM) inhibitors of CYP3A4, decreased the rate of production of <START:DRUG> norcodeine <END> by 60 and 45% compared to control values, respectively.
Similarly, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (10 microM) and <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> (10 microM) inhibitedcodeine N-demethylation by 75 and 35%, respectively.
In contrast, the presence of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , or <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> in the incubation mixture had no effect on norcodeineformation.
Preincubation with antibodies raised to CYP3A4 (5 mg lgG/nmol P450) caused 96% inhibition of <START:DRUG> norcodeine <END> production, whereas preimmune IgG or antibodies raised to CYP2A6 and CYP2C had no effect.
Coadministration of <START:DRUG> codeine <END> with selective inhibitors of CYP3A4may result in increasedmorphine production and enhanced pharmacodynamic effects due to shunting down the CYP2D6 pathway.
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is N-demethylated by cytochromes P450 2D6, 1A2 and 3A4--implications for susceptibility to Parkinson's disease.
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces a Parkinson-like syndrome through biotransformation by monoamine oxidase B to the neurotoxic metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine.
Neuroprotection may be provided by parallel N-demethylation and N-oxidation pathways mediated by the microsomal cytochrome P450 and flavin monooxygenase systems, respectively.
The aims of this study were to characterise the N-demethylation of MPTP by human liver microsomes over a wide range of concentrations, and to identify the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in this reaction.
The kinetics of the N-demethylation of MPTP (1 microM - 3 mM) by microsomes from the liver of an extensive metabolizer with respect to cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) activity were biphasic (apparent Km1 and Km2 values = 48 and 2882 microM).
The high affinity activity was abolished in the presence of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (1 microM) and was absent in microsomes from a genotypically poor metabolizer with respect to CYP2D6.
Yeast microsomes containing heterologously expressed CYP2D6 N-demethylated MPTP (Km = 39 microM), and there was a high correlation between the <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> -inhibitable N-demethylation of MPTP (50 microM) (0.7-91%, mean 44%, of total activity) and the alpha-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> metoprolol <END> in microsomes from 11 human livers (rs = 0.92; P < .001).
At 50 microM MPTP, N-demethylase activity in human liver microsomes was also inhibited by <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> (10 microM) and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> (2 microM) (mean inhibition39 and 13%, respectively; n = 11 livers).
Yeast microsomes containing heterologously expressed human CYP1A2 N-demethylated MPTP with a Km of 2246 microM.
These findings indicate that CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent CYP3A4, may have a role in protecting against Parkinson's disease induced by MPTP and other potential environmental neurotoxins.
The data provide some biochemical support for the proposition that genotypically poor metabolizers with respect to CYP2D6 are overrepresented in some populations of Parkinson's patients, and that smokers (induced CYP1A2?)"
are underrepresented.

Use of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to study the role of CYP2D6 in the in vitro metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists.
An electrospray ionization liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (ESI-LC-MS) method has been developed to study the involvement of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 in the in vitro metabolism of the <START:DRUG> indole <END> containing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(3)++) receptor antagonists <START:DRUG> tropisetron <END> , <START:DRUG> ondansetron <END> and <START:DRUG> dolasetron <END> in human liver microsomes.
Compounds were eluted using linear gradients of acetonitrile-20 mM ammonium acetate, solvent A, (10:90, v/v) (pH 6.0) and solvent B, (60:40, v/v) (pH 6.0) and a Nucleosil C(4) column.
Microsomal incubations were analysed using selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion of parent drug and the molecular ion of hydroxylated metabolites.
The involvement of CYP2D6 in drug metabolism was assessed by inhibition studies using <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (5 mu M), a specific inhibitor of human CYP2D6, as well as by incubating compounds with microsomes prepared from cells transfected with cDNA encoding human CYP2D6.
The present method can be applied to pre-clinical compounds, at an early stage of drug discovery, to assess the involvement of CYP2D6 in their metabolism and to screen for those compounds where CYP2D6 is the only isoenzyme implicated in the formation of major metabolites.
Results showed that the oxidation of all three compounds involved CYP2D6, but only that of <START:DRUG> tropisetron <END> was inhibited by over 90% in the presence of <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
Metabolism of the new immunosuppressor <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G by human liver cytochromes P450.
 <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G is a new immunosuppressor structurally similar to <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A. "
Although this drug is pharmacologically as active as <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A, it is less toxic, in particular at the kidney level.
We conclude that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G in human liver.
The aim of this work was to identify the enzyme system(s) involved in the oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G in man: (1) in a bank of human liver microsomes (n = 22), <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G oxidase activity correlatedsignificantly with <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A oxidase activity (P < 0.0001) and with the level of CYP3A4 (P < 0.002), determined by immunoblot; (2) specific inhibitors of CYP3A4, <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , inhibitedcyclosporin G oxidase activity by more than 80%; (3) antiCYP3A4 antibodies specifically inhibited this activity by nearly 90%; (4) <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A was a competitive inhibitor of <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G oxidase and vice versa; (5).
Among a battery of cDNA-expressed CYPs, only CYP3A4 was able to generate detectable amounts of metabolites of <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G and <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> A with a turnover number close to that calculated from experiments with liver microsomes; (6) in human hepatocytes in culture, pretreatment of cells with <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , 2 inducers of CYP3A4, produced a greatincrease in <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> G oxidase activity, while <START:DRUG> beta-naphthoflavone <END> , an inducer of CYP1As, did not.
In vitro interaction of the antipsychotic agent <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> with human cytochromes P450 CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A.
1.
The ability of <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> to inhibit the metabolism of marker catalytic activities for the cytochromes P450 CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was examined.
This inhibitory capability was compared with that obtained with <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> and known inhibitory compounds for the same cytochromes P450.
2.
3.
Total <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> vs unbound <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> was used to model the worst case (most conservative) situation.
In all cases, the calculated percent inhibition of these cytochromes P450 by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> was < 0.3%, suggesting that there would be little in vivo inhibition of the metabolism of substrates of these enzymes when co-administered with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> .
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> , <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> , and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> were all found to non-competitively inhibit 1'-hydroxy midazolamformation, form selective for CYP3A, yielding Ki values of 491, 99 and 0.11 microM, respectively.
The 1'-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> , form selective for CYP2D6, was competitively inhibited by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> (Ki = 89 microM), <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> (Ki = 19 microM), and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (Ki = 0.03 microM).
Tolbutamidemetabolism to 4-hydroxy <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> , form selective for CYP2C9, was competitively inhibited by <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> and <START:DRUG> phenytoin <END> (Ki of 31 microM and 17 microM, respectively).
 <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> non-competitively inhibitedtolbutamidemetabolism with a Ki of 715 microM.
The marker catalytic activity for CYP2C19 mediated metabolism, 4'-hydroxy S-mephenytoinformation, was competitively inhibited by <START:DRUG> clozapine <END> (Ki = 69 microM) and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> (Ki = 4.1 microM).
Non-competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 mediated metabolism was seen with <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> with a Ki of 920 microM.
The calculated percent inhibition by <START:DRUG> olanzapine <END> of substrates metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was modeled assuming a total plasma concentration in the therapeutic range (0.2 microM).
Role of cytochrome P450 3A4 in human metabolism of <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> , a potent human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor.
 <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> ( <START:DRUG> l-735,524 <END> ) is a potent human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor under investigation in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Five in vitro approaches have been used to identify the cytochrome P450 isoform(s) responsible for the human microsomal oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> .
These approaches are: 1) chemical inhibition; 2) immunochemical inhibition; 3) metabolism by cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes; 4) a correlation analysis; and 5) competitive inhibition of marker activities.
This suggested the involvement of CYP3A4 in MK-639metabolism.
Human recombinant CYP3A4 showed a high metabolic activity to form all <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> metabolites found in native human liver microsomes.
In addition, the formation of individual <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> metabolites correlated well with each other and with <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation in 12 different human liver microsomes, whereas no correlation was observed between <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> metabolite formation and <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylation (or <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> methyl hydroxylation).
Collectively, these results consistently indicate that CYP3A4 is the isoform responsible for the oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> in human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , both selective inhibitors for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), markedly inhibited the formation of all oxidative metabolites of <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> ; whereas other inhibitors ( <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> , <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , and <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> ) had little effect on MK-639metabolism.
Consistent with this, an anti-rat CYP3A1 rabbit polyclonal antibody, which shows a cross-reactive inhibition of CYP3A4-dependent <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes, completely inhibited <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> metabolism.
Furthermore, MK-639strongly inhibitedtestosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner.
Kinetic analysis showed that <START:DRUG> mK-639 <END> is a very potent competitive inhibitor for <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6beta-hydroxylation, with a Ki value of approximately 0.5 mu M. ")
Induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in cultured precision-cut rat and human liver slices.
1.
The effect of some xenobiotics on levels of selected cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes determined by Western immunoblotting and associated enzyme activities has been studied in 72-h cultured rat and human precision-cut liver slices.
2.
In cultured rat liver slices, 0.5 mM sodium <START:DRUG> phenobarbitone <END> (PB), 25 microMbeta-naphthoflavone (BNF), and 20 micrograms/mlAroclor 1254 (ARO)induced mixed-function oxidase enzyme activities.
Western immunoblotting of liver slice microsomes was performed with antibodies to rat CYP1A2, 2B1/2 and 3A.
Compared with 72-h control (dimethyl sulphoxide only treated) rat liver slice microsomes, PB inducedCYP2B1/2 and 3A, BNF inducedCYP1A2, and AROinducedCYP1A2, 2B1/2, and 3A.
3.
The peroxisome proliferators <START:DRUG> methylclofenapate <END> (MCP), <START:DRUG> ciprofibrate <END> (CIP) and Wy-14,643 (WY)induced palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in 72-h cultured rat liver slices.
Compared with 72-h control rat liver slice microsomes, MCP, CIP, and WY all induced levels of CYP4A.
4.
Further studies would be required to confirm that CYP4A isoenzymes could be induced by xenobiotics in human liver slices.
5.
These results demonstrate that cultured liver slices may be used in evaluating the effect of xenobiotics on both rat and human CYP isoenzymes.
In cultured human liver slices, 20 micrograms/ml ARO, but not 0.5 mM MCP, induced 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> O-deethylase activity.
NeitherAROnorMCP had any effect on homogenate palmitoyl-CoA oxidation and microsomal <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid 11- and 12-hydroxylase activities.
Compared with 72-h control human liver slice microsomes, AROinducedCYP1A2, and MCP appeared to induce CYP4A.
In vitro comparative inhibition profiles of major human drug metabolising cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
The affinity of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)- <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> , a new synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor developed as a racemate, for specific human P450 monooxygenases in liver microsomes was compared with that of the pharmacologically active acidic forms of <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> , <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> .
Affinity was determined as the inhibitory potency for prototype reactions for 3 major drug metabolising enzymes: <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation (CYP2D6), and <START:DRUG> midazolam <END> 1'-hydroxylation (CYP3A4).
As already reported for <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> , in vivo drug interactions by inhibition of liver oxidation of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. hypoglyceamic sulphonylureas and oral anticoagulants) may be expected.
 <START:DRUG> lovastatin <END> acid, <START:DRUG> pravastatin <END> and <START:DRUG> simvastatin <END> acid displayed moderate affinity for all three P450 isozymes (estimated Ki> 50 micromol.1(-1)).
Racemic and (+)- and (-)- <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> showed moderate affinity (estimated Ki> 50 micromol.1(-1)) for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas their affinity for CYP2C9 was high (estimated Ki< 1 micromol.1(-1)).
 <START:DRUG> diclofenac <END> 4'-hydroxylation was competitively and stereoselectively inhibited, with measured Ki's of 0.06 and 0.28 micromol.1(-1) for (+)- and (-)- <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> , respectively.
 <START:DRUG> fluvastatin <END> selectively inhibits a major drug metabolising enzyme (CYP2C9), the (+)-isomer (pharmacologically more active) showing 4-5 fold higher affinity.
Potent and selective inactivation of human liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 isoforms by <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> , an investigational human immune deficiency virus protease inhibitor.
 <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> , N- [2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl]-5- [2(S)-(1,1-dimethylethylaminocarbonyl)-4- [(furo [2,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)methyl]piperazin-1-yl]-4(S)-hydroxy-2(R) - phenylmethylpentanamide, is a potent and specific inhibitor of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) protease.
Thus, for <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylase, the inactivation kinetic constants, Kl and kinact, were 7.5 microM and 1.62 min-1, respectively, and the partition ratio (moles product formed per moles enzyme inactivated) was approximately 1.35.
However, exogenously added nucleophiles (GSH, semicarbazide and N- <START:DRUG> acetylcysteine <END> ) failed to protect against P-450 inactivation.
These results suggest that the inactivation process likely is mediated by a reactive metabolite of <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> that alkylates, and thereby destroys, the enzyme.
Furthermore, this electrophilic intermediate may not be released into the medium before the inactivation event.
The drug selectively inhibited human liver microsomal CYP 3A4-dependent <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylase and CYP 2D6-dependent <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> 1'-hydroxylase activities in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the presence of an NADPH-generating system.
 <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> was found to be a very potent inactivator of CYP 3A4.
To a lesser extent, <START:DRUG> l-754,394 <END> also was an inactivator of CYP 2D6, for which the corresponding values for Kl, kinact and partition ratio were 32 microM, 0.18 min-1 and 40, respectively.
CYP 3A4inactivation was reduced markedly by <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , a selective CYP 3A4 inhibitor.
Similarly, CYP 2D6inactivation also was prevented by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a specific competitive inhibitor of this isoform.
Validation of the (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid as an in vitro substrate probe for human liver CYP2E1.
The (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid (11-OH-LA), a model substrate of fatty acids, was previously shown to be due to CYP2E1 in rat liver microsomes.
The present study examined changes in hepatic CYP2E1 content and 11-OH-LA in a panel of 29 human liver microsomes.
The 11-OH-LA activity was strongly correlated with the CYP2E1 content, quantitated by immunoblot (r = 0.75) and with four monooxygenase activities known to be mediated by CYP2E1: <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> -6-hydroxylation (r = 0.73), 4-nitrophenol hydroxylation (r = 0.84), N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylation (r = 0.79) and n-butanol oxidation (r = 0.73).
The weak value of ethanolKi on the (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid suggested that low levels of alcohol could modify fatty acid metabolism in the liver.
Polyclonal antibody directed against rat CYP2E1inhibited the formation of 11-OH-LA without affecting 12-OH-LA activity.
Taken together, these results suggest that CYP2E1 is involved in the (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid in human liver microsomes, and omega-hydroxylation is mediated by another enzyme.
Finally, the use of yeasts and mammalian cells genetically engineered for expression of 9 human P450s demonstrated that CYP2E1 was the one enzyme involved in the (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid.
The (omega-1)-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid was inhibited by <START:DRUG> ethanol <END> (Ki = 3.5 mM), <START:DRUG> acetone <END> (IC50 = 10 mM) <START:DRUG> dimethylsulfoxide <END> , <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> (competitive inhibitors of CYP2E1), <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , and <START:DRUG> diallylsulfide <END> (both selective mechanism-based inactivators of CYP2E1).
 <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> and <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> , suicide substrates of CYP1A and CYP3A4, respectively, did not modify the 11-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> lauric <END> acid.
The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and their metabolites on S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes.
The inhibitory effects of four selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> , <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> and <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> , and three metabolites ( <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> demethylcitalopram <END> and <START:DRUG> didemethylcitalopram <END> ), on S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation activities in human liver microsomes were studied.
The findings suggest that some SSRIs and their metabolites with a low Ki value (e.g., <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> ) may reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by this isoform of P450, thereby resulting in a possible drug-drug interaction, when administered simultaneously.
In addition, SSRIs and their metabolites examined herein may be substrates toward CYP2C19.
The 4'-hydroxylation of S- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , a representative substrate toward CYP2C19, was competitively inhibited by all the SSRIs and their metabolites studied.
The mean Ki values of <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> , <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , <START:DRUG> citalopram <END> , <START:DRUG> demethylcitalopram <END> and <START:DRUG> didemethylcitalopram <END> were 5.2, 1.1, 2.0, 7.5, 87.3, 55.8 and 7.7 microM, respectively.
N-demethylation of <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> in vitro: role of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms and effect of metabolic inhibitors.
Biotransformation of <START:DRUG> amitriptyline <END> (AMI) to its demethylated product <START:DRUG> nortriptyline <END> (NT) was studied in vitro with human liver microsomes from four different donors, preselected to reflect a range of metabolic rates.
Reaction velocity versus substrate concentration was consistent with a sigmoid Vmax model.
Vmax varied from 0.42 to 3.42 nmol/mg/min, Km from 33 to 89 microM AMI.
A polyclonal rabbit antibody against rat liver CYP3A1, in antibody/microsomal protein ratios varying from 1:1 to 10:1, inhibited N-demethylation of AMI to an asymptotic maximum of 60%.
These results are consistent with several case reports describing impairment of AMI metabolism by SSRIs.
Inhibition of AMI demethylation by low concentrations of <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> and by anti-3A antibody supports an important role for CYP3A isoforms in mediating this reaction.
 <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was a highly potent inhibitor of N-demethylation, with a mean Ki value of 0.11 +/- 0.013 microM (+/- S.D.), whereas <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (up to 50 microM), a CYP2D6 inhibitor, and <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> (up to 5 microM), a CYP1A2inhibitor only at low concentrations, showed no effect.
All selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) tested had an inhibitory effect on the formation of NT, with mean Ki values of 4.37 (+/- 3.38) microM for <START:DRUG> sertraline <END> , 5.46 (+/- 1.95) microM for <START:DRUG> desmethylsertraline <END> , 9.22 (+/- 3.69) microM for <START:DRUG> fluvoxamine <END> , 12.26 (+/- 5.67) microM for <START:DRUG> norfluoxetine <END> , 15.76 (+/- 5.05) microM for <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> , and 43.55 (+/- 18.28) microM for <START:DRUG> fluoxetine <END> .
Human liver oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> .
The oxidation of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> , an inactivator of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, was examined using human liver cytosol, microsomes, and several P450 isoforms.
Inhibition by <START:DRUG> allopurinol <END> , a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, was less dramatic.
Human P450s CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 expressed in Hep G2 hepatoma cells using vaccinia virus vectors were incubated with 10 or 200 microMO6-benzylguanine.
However, an appreciable increase in CYP3A4 contribution was noted at 200 microM.
CYP1A2 exhibited a more than 200-fold higher relative catalytic activity (Vmax/Km) compared with CYP3A4.
However, one would expect interindividual variation in the extent of oxidation of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> depending on the levels of aldehyde oxidase, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4.
Incubation of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> with human liver cytosol resulted in the formation of O6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine, which was inhibited by <START:DRUG> menadione <END> , a potent inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase.
Oxidation of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> also occurred with pooled human liver microsomes and was inhibited by both <START:DRUG> furafylline <END> and <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, respectively.
At 10 microM, <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> was oxidized primarily by CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.
Therefore, at therapeutically relevant concentrations of <START:DRUG> o6-benzylguanine <END> , CYP1A2 could be primarily involved in its oxidation since it shows a much lower Km value (1.3 microM) than CYP3A4 (52.2 microM) and cytosol (81.5 microM).
An investigation of the interaction between <START:DRUG> halofantrine <END> , CYP2D6 and CYP3A4: studies with human liver microsomes and heterologous enzyme expression systems.
1.
We have assessed the interaction of the antimalarial <START:DRUG> halofantrine <END> with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in vitro, with the use of microsomes from human liver and recombinant cell lines.
2.
Of a group of structurally related antimalarials tested, only <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> (IC50 = 0.04 microM) was more potent.
3.
4.
5.
6.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that <START:DRUG> halofantrine <END> is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and can also be metabolised by the enzyme.
However, in human liver microsomes it appears to be metabolised largely by CYP3A4.
Rac- <START:DRUG> halofantrine <END> was a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 1.06 microM, Ki = 4.3 microM) of the 1-hydroxylation of <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> , a marker for CYP2D6 activity.
Microsomes prepared from recombinant CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 cell lines were shown to catalysehalofantrine N-debutylation.
The metabolism of <START:DRUG> halofantrine <END> to its N-desbutyl metabolite by human liver microsomes showed no correlation with CYP2D6 genotypic or phenotypic status and there was no consistent inhibition by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> .
The rate of halofantrinemetabolism showed a significantcorrelation with both CYP3A4 protein levels (r = 0.88, P = 0.01) and the rate of felodipinemetabolism (r = 0.86, P = 0.013), a marker substrate for CYP3A4 activity.
Inhibition studies showed that <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> is a potent inhibitor of halofantrinemetabolism (IC50 = 1.57 microM).
Oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> by human liver cytochromes P450.
The aim of this work was to identify the form(s) of human cytochrome P450 (P450) involved in the hepatic biotransformation of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> to its two main metabolites, i.e., the sulfone and the hydroxy derivative.
In liver microsomes, the production of the sulfone of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> correlated with the level of P450 3A4, <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> oxidase, and the production of the hydroxy derivative, as well as of <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfone.
The production of hydroxylansoprazole moderately correlated with the level of P450 3A4, <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> oxidase, and (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase.
Among several forms of cDNA-expressed human P450s, 3A4 generated significant amounts of the sulfones of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> and 2C18 was active for the production of hydroxylansoprazole but inactive in the 4'-hydroxylation of (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> .
We conclude that P450 3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the production of the sulfone of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and that this P450, as well as P450 2C18 and/or another 2C-related form, could contribute to the production of hydroxylansoprazole.
The production of the sulfone and of the hydroxy derivative of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> was significantly inhibited by anti-P450 3A4 antibodies, by <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , and by <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> .
Anti-P450 2C8 and 2C3 antibodies moderately inhibited the biotransformation of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> , whereas they completely inhibited (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylase activity under the same conditions.
In primary cultures of human hepatocytes, the biotransformation of <START:DRUG> lansoprazole <END> and the oxidation of <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> were strongly increased by <START:DRUG> rifampicin <END> and <START:DRUG> phenobarbital <END> , whereas (S)- <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> 4'-hydroxylation was not.
 <START:DRUG> beta-naphthoflavone <END> did not induce the formation of the sulfones but stimulated the production of hydroxylansoprazole.
Biotransformation of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> to its active carboxylic acid metabolite in human liver microsomes.
Role of cytochrome P4502C and 3A subfamily members.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> is a 4-chloro-5-hydroxymethylimidazole derivative that is a potent and highly selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
 <START:DRUG> losartan <END> is metabolized in vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans to a carboxylic acid derivative E3174 that is pharmacologically more active than the parent compound.
We have investigated the mechanism of this biotransformation in human liver preparations.
The oxidation of both <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and the putative aldehyde intermediate E3179 was catalyzed by the microsomal fraction, required both NADPH and molecular oxygen, and was inhibited by SKF 525-A, implicating cytochrome P450 (CYP).
When incubations with each substrate were performed under an atmosphere of 18O2, the extent of 18O incorporation into the carboxylic acid product was consistent with a mechanism for losartanoxidation involving an aldehyde intermediate.
To substantiate the involvement of CYP in these reactions, incubations with <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and the aldehyde E3179 were performed in the presence of isoform-selective inhibitors.
These studies support the hypothesis that the aldehyde E3179 is an intermediate in the oxidation of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and that this two-step reaction is catalyzed in human liver microsomes by members of the CYP3A and CYP2C subfamilies.
Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 ( <START:DRUG> gestodene <END> and <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> ) and CYP2C9/10 ( <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> ) attenuated the oxidation of both substrates.
It was then demonstrated that microsomes containing either recombinant human liver CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 were capable of oxidizing both <START:DRUG> losartan <END> and the aldehyde E3179 to the carboxylic acid E3174.
Subsequently, it was shown that rabbit anti-CYP2C9 and anti-CYP3A3/4 inhibited the oxidation of <START:DRUG> losartan <END> to E3174 in incubations with human liver microsomes.
Evidence for a role of cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 in <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> metabolism.
 <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> is metabolised by N-demethylation (to <START:DRUG> norethylmorphine <END> ) and by O-deethylation (to <START:DRUG> morphine <END> ).
The O-deethylation reaction was previously shown in vivo to co-segregate with the O-demethylation of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> indicating that <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> is a substrate of polymorphic cytochrome P450(CYP)2D6.
To study further the features of <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> metabolism we investigated its N-demethylation and O-deethylation in human liver microsomes from eight extensive (EM) and one poor metaboliser (PM) of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> .
Whereas N-demethylation varied only two-fold there was a 4.3-fold variation in the O-deethylation of <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> , the lowest rate being observed in the PM.
 <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , at a concentration of 1 microM, inhibited O-deethylation in microsomes from an EM, but was unable to do so in microsomes from the PM.
The immunoidentified CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 correlated with the rates of O-deethylation (r = 0.972) and N-demethylation (r = 0.969), respectively.
We conclude that the O-deethylation of <START:DRUG> ethylmorphine <END> is catalysed by the CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes consistent with previous findings in healthy volunteers.
 <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes in human liver.
 <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> is a synthetic glucocorticosteroid that is commonly used in topical treatment of asthma and rhinitis.
The main metabolites formed from <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> in human liver microsomes have been identified as 16 alpha-hydroxyprednisolone and 6 beta-hydroxy- <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> .
Although it is apparent that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is involved, the actual subfamily has not been identified.
In attempts to do this, <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> was incubated with microsomes from ten different human liver samples where various CYP activities had been rank ordered.
We found a strong correlation between formation of the two main metabolites and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylation (correlation 0.98 and 0.95), a marker for CYP3A.
When <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> (10 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of compounds known to interact with different isoforms or subfamilies of CYP, <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> was found to be the strongest inhibitor of budesonidemetabolism (IC50: approximately 0.1 microM) followed by <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> (IC50: approximately 1 microM), <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> cyclosporin <END> , all substances known to interact with CYP3A isoenzymes.
Substances known to interact with CYP2C ( <START:DRUG> sulfaphenazole <END> , <START:DRUG> mephenytoin <END> , and <START:DRUG> tolbutamide <END> ) and with CYP2D6 ( <START:DRUG> bufuralol <END> and <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> ) did not specifically inhibit the metabolism of <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> .
In addition, formation of the <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> metabolites (16 alpha-hydroxyprednisolone and 6 beta-hydroxybudesonide) was inhibited by antibodies against the CYP3A subfamily, but not by antibodies against the CYP1A subfamily or control immunoglobulin G. We conclude that the formation of 16 alpha-hydroxyprednisolone and 6 beta-hydroxybudesonide from <START:DRUG> budesonide <END> is catalyzed by isoenzymes within the CYP3A subfamily.
Involvement of a cytochrome P4502D subfamily in human liver microsomal <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> 4-hydroxylation.
The oxidative metabolism of <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> , an adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist was examined in human liver microsomes fortified with an NADPH-generating system.
These results suggest that CYP2D6 is involved in the <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> 4-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes.
The microsomal fractions (n = 11) showed <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> 4-hydroxylase activities, which correlated well with CYP2D6 contents (correlation coefficient, r = 0.854), <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> 4-hydroxylase (r = 0.953) and <START:DRUG> imipramine <END> 2-hydroxylase (r = 0.976) activities.
On the other hand, the <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> 4-hydroxylase activity showed relatively poor correlations with CYP3A4 content (r = 0.552) and <START:DRUG> testosterone <END> 6 beta-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.668).
The <START:DRUG> bunitrolol <END> 4-hydroxylase activity was significantly inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , a selective inhibitor for CYP2D6.
Polyclonal antibodies raised against rat liver microsomal cytochrome P450BTL, which is thought to belong to the CYP2D subfamily, effectively inhibitedbunitrolol 4-hydroxylation.
In contrast, polyclonal antibodies raised against human liver microsomal CYP3A4 did not show any inhibitory effect on the activity.
Caffeinemetabolism by human hepatic cytochromes P450: contributions of 1A2, 2E1 and 3A isoforms.
 <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> (CA) N1-, N3- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylase <END> , CA 8-hydroxylase and <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activities were measured in microsomes from 18 separate human livers which had been characterized previously for a range of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-specific activities and immunoreactive CYP protein contents.
Correlations between the high affinity components of the three separate CA N-demethylations were highly significant (r = 0.77-0.91, P < 0.001) and each of the three high affinity CA N-demethylations correlatedsignificantly (r = 0.64-0.93, P < 0.05-0.001) with the high affinity <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase, <START:DRUG> 2-acetylaminofluorene <END> N-hydroxylation and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) mutagenicity (all predominantly CYP1A2-mediated reactions).
The low affinity components of CA N1- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylation <END> correlatedsignificantly (r = 0.55-0.85, P < 0.05-0.001) with immunoreactive CYP2E1 content and the CYP2E1-specific activities 4-nitrophenol and <START:DRUG> chlorzoxazone <END> hydroxylation.
The apparent Km values for CA N1- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylation <END> by cDNA-expressed CYP2E1 (namely 28 and 43 mM, respectively) were of a similar order to those calculated for the low affinity microsomal activities.
Effects of <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> and <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> on microsomal CA 8-hydroxylation were generally consistent with CYP3A involvement.
Taken together with previous data, the results indicate a major involvement of CYP1A2 in the high affinity component of all three human hepatic CA N-demethylations.
In contrast, CYP2E1 appears to be the main enzyme involved in the low affinity components of CA N1- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylation <END> while CA 8-hydroxylation is catalysed predominantly by a CYP3A isoform(s).
Consistent with these observations, cDNA-expressed human CYP1A2catalyzed the N1-, N3- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylation <END> of CA and apparent Km values were similar (0.24-0.28 mM) for all three reactions and comparable to those observed previously with human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> diethyldithiocarbamate <END> , a selective inhibitor of CYP2E1, inhibited the low affinity CA N1- and <START:DRUG> n7-demethylation <END> , with IC50 values of 23 microM and 11 microM, respectively.
significant correlations (r = 0.87-0.97, P < 0.001) were observed between CA 8-hydroxylation and immunoreactive CYP3A content and the CYP3A-mediated reactions benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation, <START:DRUG> omeprazole <END> sulfoxidation and aflatoxin B1 mutagenesis.
Involvement of human liver cytochrome P450 3A in <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism: drug interactions.
 <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> biotransformation was investigated by using a human liver microsomes library.
The drug was converted into one major metabolite (M) upon incubation with the microsomes.
A large interindividual variation in <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism was observed among the samples tested, with a 4.4 ratio between the lowest and the highest metabolic rates.
The biotransformation of <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 6.82 +/- 0.27 microM and Vmax = 0.64 +/- 0.06 nmol/min/mg protein).
These metabolic drug interactions may alter the antitumor activity and/or toxicity of the drug during anticancer chemotherapy.
The involvement of the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily in <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism was demonstrated by the following body of evidence: (a) the competitive inhibition of <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> biotransformation by cytochrome P450 3A specific probes with Ki values of 0.17, 22.5, 14.8, and 35.3 microM for <START:DRUG> ketoconazole <END> , <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> , <START:DRUG> troleandomycin <END> , and <START:DRUG> vindesine <END> , respectively; (b) the immuno inhibition of <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism by polyclonal anti-cytochrome P450 3A antibodies; (c) the highly significantcorrelation between the level of cytochrome P450 3A determined by Western blots and <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism (r = 0.759, P < 0.001); (d) the highly significantcorrelation between <START:DRUG> erythromycin <END> N-demethylase activity (mediated by cytochrome P450 3A) and <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism (r = 0.83, P < 0.001); (e) the significantcorrelation between the CYP3A4 mRNA level and <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> metabolism (r = 0.60, P < 0.1).
Although <START:DRUG> vincristine <END> and navelbine (members of the Vinca alkaloid family) also inhibit the metabolism of <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> , suggesting the involvement of the cytochrome subfamily in their respective metabolisms, other anticancer drugs currently associated with <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> in chemotherapy ( <START:DRUG> etoposide <END> , <START:DRUG> adriamycin <END> , <START:DRUG> lomustine <END> , and <START:DRUG> teniposide <END> ) also interfere with <START:DRUG> vinblastine <END> biotransformation.
Specificity of substrate and inhibitor probes for human cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1A2.
Kinetic and inhibitor studies using cDNA-expressed enzymes and human liver microsomes have characterized the specificity of a range of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1Asubstrate and inhibitor probes towards the two isoforms comprising this subfamily.
Expressed CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 both catalyzed the O-deethylation of <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> , although the apparent Km was about 4-foldlower for CYP1A2 (25 vs. 108 microM).
 <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation exhibited biphasic kinetics in human liver microsomes, and the apparent Km for the high-affinity component (9 +/- 6 microM) was consistent with the involvement of CYP1A2 in this reaction.
Together with previous data, the results indicate that the majority of human CYP1A xenobiotic inhibitor and substrate probes are nonspecific in their recognition of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, although selectivity is apparent for some compounds.
The prototypic CYP1A xenobiotic inhibitor and substrate probes <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> , <START:DRUG> ellipticine <END> , <START:DRUG> 7-ethoxycoumarin <END> and 7- <START:DRUG> ethoxyresorufin <END> all inhibitedCYP1A1- and CYP1A2-mediated <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation as well as the high-affinity component of human liver <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase activity.
 <START:DRUG> alpha-naphthoflavone <END> and <START:DRUG> 7-ethoxycoumarin <END> were, however, approximately 10-fold more potent as inhibitors of CYP1A2 than CYP1A1.
Other putative human CYP1A xenobiotic substrates and inhibitors, including <START:DRUG> caffeine <END> , 5- and <START:DRUG> 8-methoxypsoralen <END> , <START:DRUG> nifedipine <END> , <START:DRUG> paraxanthine <END> , <START:DRUG> propranolol <END> and <START:DRUG> theophylline <END> similarly inhibitedCYP1A1- and 1A2-catalyzedphenacetin O-deethylation and the high-affinity human liver <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylase.
In contrast, the monoclonal antibody MAb 1-7-1, raised against 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible rat cytochromes 450, almost abolished CYP1A1-mediated <START:DRUG> phenacetin <END> O-deethylation, but had no effect on human liver microsomal- or CYP1A2-catalyzedphenacetin dealkylation.
The role of cytochrome P4502D6 in the metabolism of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> by human liver microsomes.
 <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor possessing anti-depressant activity.
Demethylenation of the methylenedioxy phenyl group is the initial step in its metabolism, the liberated carbon appearing in vitro as formate.
A radioassay involving [14C-methylenedioxy] <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> was developed and used to examine the role of cytochrome P4502D6 in paroxetinemetabolism by human liver microsomes.
The rate of formate production was much higher in microsomes from an extensive metaboliser of <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> than from a poor metaboliser.
These observations strongly suggested that the process was catalysed by the enzyme cytochrome P4502D6.
The ability of microsomes from a poor metaboliser of <START:DRUG> debrisoquine <END> to demethylenate <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> provided further evidence for the involvement of an enzyme distinct from P4502D6.
This was confirmed by kinetic analysis of the process in microsomes from both poor and extensive metabolisers.
It is concluded that, in man, the initial step of paroxetinemetabolism is performed by at least two enzymes, one of which is cytochrome P4502D6.
Also, demethylenation of <START:DRUG> paroxetine <END> was inhibited by the <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> and <START:DRUG> quinine <END> isomer pair in microsomes from the extensive metaboliser only.
Metabolism could not be completely inhibited by <START:DRUG> quinidine <END> , the residual activity representing the contribution of at least one other enzyme.
Inhibition of debrisoquinclearance in perfused rat livers and inhibition of dextromethorphanmetabolism in human liver microsomes by <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> or other metabolites of <START:DRUG> debrisoquin <END> .
 <START:DRUG> debrisoquin <END> undergoes oxidative metabolism to <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> , catalyzed by cytochrome CYP2D1 in rats and CYP2D6 in humans.
Cytochrome CYP2D6 also plays a major role in <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation.
In preliminary studies in perfused Lewis rat livers, we observed a difference in repeat clearance experiments using <START:DRUG> debrisoquin <END> , but not <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> .
To determine whether this change in clearance with time was due to the accumulation of <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> , we sequentially used a recirculating and nonrecirculating perfusion system in the same liver perfusion experiment.
We also studied the kinetics of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> O-demethylation in microsomes prepared from human and rat livers in the presence and absence of <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> .
Results from the perfused rat liver experiments showed a drop in clearance from 3.27 +/- 0.57 ml/min (clearance 1) to 1.61 +/- 0.27 ml/min (clearance 2) (p less than 0.05 vs. clearance 1) during recirculation, but clearancereturned to 3.21 +/- 0.46 ml/min (clearance 3, no significance vs. clearance 1) after a 30-min period of liver perfusion using a nonrecirculating system.
There was significant accumulation of <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> in the liver perfusate during recirculation, and concentrations fell when the nonrecirculating system was used.
In microsomal studies, <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> competitively inhibiteddextromethorphanmetabolism in human microsomes was 600 microM.
These data suggest that: (a) <START:DRUG> 4-hydroxydebrisoquin <END> and/or other metabolites of <START:DRUG> debrisoquin <END> have an inhibitory effect on CYP2D1 and CYP2D6; (b) the active site of human CYP2D6 has different substrate specificity than the rat isozyme (CYP2D1) and/or that the pathways of metabolism of <START:DRUG> dextromethorphan <END> are different in the Lewis rat and not primarily dependent on the activity of CYP2D1.)

NO-independent regulatory site of direct sGC stimulators like YC-1 and BAY 41-2272
Background
The most important receptor for nitic oxide is the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a <START:DRUG> heme <END> containing heterodimer.
Recently, a pyrazolopyridine derivative BAY 41-2272, structurally related to YC-1, was identified stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase in an NO-independent manner, which results in vasodilatation and antiplatelet activity.
The study described here addresses the identification of the NO-independent site on soluble guanylate cyclase.
Results
We developed a photoaffinity label ( 3 H-meta-PAL) for the direct and NO-independent soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator BAY 41-2272 by introducing an azido-group into the tritium labeled compound.
The synthesized photoaffinitylabel directly stimulates the purified sGC and shows in combination with NO a synergistic effect on sGC activity.
Irradiation with UV light of 3 H-meta-PAL together with the highly purified sGC leads to a covalent binding to the α 1 -subunit of the enzyme.
This binding is blocked by unlabeled meta-PAL, YC-1 and BAY 41-2272.
For further identification of the NO-independent regulatory site the 3 H-meta-PAL labeled sGC was fragmented by CNBr digest.
The 3 H-meta-PAL binds to a CNBr fragment, consisting of the amino acids 236–290 of the α 1 -subunit.
Determination of radioactivity of the single PTH-cycles from the sequencing of this CNBr fragment detected the cysteines 238 and 243 as binding residues of the 3 H-meta-PAL.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrate that the region surrounding the cysteines 238 and 243 in the α 1 -subunit of the sGC could play an important role in regulation of sGC activity and could be the target of this new type of sGC stimulators.
Background
Guanylate cyclases (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase [cyclizing]; EC 4.6.1.2) catalyze the biosynthesis of <START:DRUG> guanosine <END> 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) from GTP.
While the membrane bound forms are monomers and stimulated by the natriuretic peptides, the soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC) exist as heterodimers consisting of an α 1 - and a β 1 -subunit and containing <START:DRUG> heme <END> as a prosthetic group [ 1 ].
Besides this major species of sGC there exist also reports of homodimeric forms of this enzyme [ 2 , 3 ].
By formation of cGMP as a second messenger, sGC plays an important role in smooth muscle cell relaxation [ 4 ], inhibition of platelet aggregation, retinal signal transduction [ 5 ] and synaptic transmission [ 6 ].
The enzyme is strongly activated by NO [ 7 ], by the new direct and NO-independent stimulator YC-1 [ 8 - 11 ], and to a lesser extend by CO [ 12 - 14 , 11 ].
Thus in several studies YC-1 was shown to be an antithrombotic agent by elevation of cGMP, VASP phosphorylation and inhibiting platelet aggregation [ 8 , 13 , 15 - 18 ].
Furthermore YC-1 was shown to relax precontracted aortic rings [ 9 ], even if they were made tolerant with glyceryl trinitrite [ 19 ] and to induce a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure [ 19 ].
Interestingly, in addition to the direct activation of the purified sGC by YC-1, an overadditive effect was observed by the combinations of YC-1 and NO or CO [ 9 - 11 , 18 , 20 ].
It was shown that YC-1 is a <START:DRUG> heme <END> -dependent but NO-independent stimulator of sGC [ 11 , 13 ].
In contrast to NO and CO which directly interact with the <START:DRUG> heme <END> group of the enzyme, YC-1 did not change the spectral characteristics of the <START:DRUG> heme <END> moiety of sGC [ 11 ].
Therefore it is believed that YC-1 did not interact directly with the <START:DRUG> heme <END> region of the sGC.
Because YC-1 sensitises the enzyme towards their endogenous ligands NO and CO, it is proposed that YC-1 binds to an allosteric site on sGC and thereby reduces the ligand dissociation rates from the <START:DRUG> heme <END> group [ 10 , 11 , 20 , 21 ].
Recently, we described the pharmacological profile of a new sGC stimulator – BAY 41-2272 with similar characteristics like YC-1, however, with a distinctly higher potency and no PDE inhibitory activity [ 22 ].
Using BAY 41-2272 as lead structure of this new pharmacological principle, we synthesized the first photoaffinity label derived from the BAY 41-2272 chemical core structure, characterized it on the purified enzyme, labeled the highly purified sGC, and identified the binding amino acids of this new type of sGC stimulators.
Results
We developed the first photoaffinity label for direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators.
Coming from YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 as lead structures of direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators we synthesized the ortho- (BAY 50-6038), meta- (BAY 51-9491) and para-PAL (BAY 50-8364) compounds (Fig. 1 ) and tested their influence on sGC activity.
The meta- and para-PAL showed on the one hand a direct sGC stimulation comparable to YC-1 and on the other hand in combination with NO distinct synergistic effects on sGC activity.
The ortho-PAL showed the lowest sGC stimulation and in combination with NO no synergistic effect on sGC activity (Tab.
1 ).
Both under reducing conditions and in the absence of DTT, in the sGC assay a similar sGC activating profile of the three PALs is given (Tab.
1 ).
Because of the more dominant stimulation of sGC by the single compound both in the presence and absence of DTT the meta-PAL compound was chosen as photoaffinitylabel for the following studies (Tab.
1 ).
Synthesis of the ortho-, meta- and para-PAL compounds.
Similar to YC-1 and BAY 41-2272, meta-PAL (BAY 51-9491) concentration-dependently stimulates purified sGC and shows in combination with NO a potentiation of sGC activity, while in combination with YC-1, only additive effects could be detected.
sGC stimulation by meta-PAL could be nearly completely blocked by ODQ and is dependent of the presence of the prosthetic <START:DRUG> heme <END> -moiety of sGC (Fig. 3a ).
As YC-1, meta-PAL does not shift the position of the Soret band of sGC both under basal and NO stimulated conditions (Fig. 3b ).
a) Stimulation of purified sGC by meta-PAL (0.3–100 μM) in the absence and presence of DEA/NO (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM), YC-1 (30 μM) and ODQ (10 μM) and stimulation of <START:DRUG> heme <END> -depleted sGC by meta-PAL in the presence of DTT and Mg 2+ as cofactor.
The specific activity of sGC is expressed as x-fold stimulation vs. basal activity (basal activity in the presence of Mg 2+ : 152 nmol/mg/min).
The data presented represent means ± SEM, from 4 independent experiments performed in duplicate.
b) <START:DRUG> heme <END> spectra (OD: optic density) of sGC under basal conditions and in the presence of the NO donor DEA/NO and the meta-PAL.
These data are representative for three independent determinations.
To optimize the irradiation conditions for the following photoaffinity studies, the NH- and CH-insertion qualities of meta-PAL (BAY 51-9491) were studied in the presence of different solution compounds by irradiation under 254 or 365 nm.
As shown in Tab.
2 , NH-insertion was more effective than CH-insertion under our conditions.
UV 254 nm was chosen as irradiation source.
In addition, the time dependency of the photoactivation of the meta-PAL (BAY 51-9491) under UV 254 nm (40 Watt, distance of 3 cm) was studied by thin layer chromatography (Rf of meta-PAL = 0.7 and of photolysed meta-PAL = 0.5).
The meta-PAL was completely destroyed after irradiation in PAL buffer within 3 min.
In the presence of glucose oxidase as model protein, meta-PAL was completely destroyed after an irradiation time of about 18 min (data not shown).
Therefore the irradiation time for the labeling studies was chosen with 15 min under 254 nm (40 Watt) at a distance of 3 cm.
For enzyme labeling, 3 H-meta-PAL was synthesized as described (Fig. 2 ).
The binding of 3 H-meta-PAL to highly purified sGC was studied both in the presence of different concentrations of sGC as different concentrations of 3 H-meta-PAL, and also in the presence of unlabeled meta-PAL (100 μM).
As shown in Fig. 4 , 3 H-meta-PAL binds concentration-dependently almost exclusively to the α 1 -subunit of the sGC after irradiation.
The radiolabeling of the β 1 -subunit is only weakly visible in the autoradiogramm after reaction of sGC with 200 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL.
In the presence of unlabeled meta-PAL (100 μM) the covalent binding of the 3 H-meta-PAL to the α 1 -subunit is obviously diminished in the presence of 20 or 2 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL.
Synthesis of the 3 H-meta-PAL.
Autoradiogram of 3 H-meta-PAL (2, 20 and 200 μCi) labeled sGC (12.5 and 25 μg) in the presence and absence of meta-PAL (100 μM) after separation in both subunits by SDS-PAGE.
In addition, we examined the effects of different sGC modulators on binding of 3 H-meta-PAL on purified sGC (Fig. 5 ).
Both unlabeled meta-PAL (100 μM and 10 μM), YC-1 (100 μM), BAY 41-2272 [ 22 ] but also ODQ (100 μM) diminished concentration-dependently the binding of 3 H-meta-PAL to the α 1 -subunit.
ODQ inhibit the binding of the 3 H-meta-PAL to the α 1 -subunit, but in this case weak unspecific labeling of the β 1 -subunit and the α 1 -subunit was detected.
3 H-meta-PAL processed with sGC without irradiation showed no insertion of radioactivity (Fig. 5 ).
Autoradiogram of 3 H-meta-PAL labeled sGC after separation by SDS-PAGE.
Lane1: 12.5 μg sGC with 3 H-meta-PAL without irradiation; Lane 2: 12.5 μg sGC with 3 H-meta-PAL after irradiation; Lane 3: as 2 but in the presence of 100 μM unlabeled meta-PAL; Lane 4: as 2 but in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled meta-PAL; Lane 5: as 2 but in the presence of 100 μM ODQ; Lane 6: as 2 but in the presence of 100 μM YC-1.
To identify the binding residues of the 3 H-meta-PAL at the α 1 -subunit, sGC was labeled with 3 H-meta-PAL and the labeled protein was fragmented by CNBr cleavage.
The resulting protein fragments were separated by electrophoresis (10–20% SDS-PAGE), transferred to a PVDF membrane, stained with Coomassie-blue and exposed to Imaging-Plates (Fig. 6 ).
The resulted autoradiogramm shows five highly labeled protein fragments (CNBr I-V) with molecular weights of 51.8 / 35.9 / 30.2 / 11.7 and 6.2 kDa (Fig. 6 ) which were identified and excised from the Coomassie-blue stained Western blots.
Sequencing of this bands showed, that they contain different fragments of both the α 1 - as the β 1 -subunit (Tab.
4 ).
For better separation of peptides in the lower molecular weight range, the same fragments were separated on a TRIS-Tricine-gel.
In this autoradiogramm we detected three highly labeled protein fragments (CNBr VI-VIII) with molecular weights of 14.7 / 11.7 and 6.2 kDa (Fig. 7 ).
Before sequencing of the different labeled sGC fragments, both intact subunits of sGC were sequenced.
We observed, that the first 20 coded amino acids of the α 1 -subunit probably belong to the presequence.
The β 1 -subunit corresponded to the published sequence.
Because of the selective labeling of the α 1 -subunit by the 3 H-meta-PAL (Fig. 4 and 5 ), in Tab.
3 only the theoretically CNBr fragments of the α 1 -subunit (AS 20-690) are aligned and signed after their position.
It is known that CNBr fragments show different migration properties in SDS-PAGE related to the used molecular weightmarkers.
Therefore in the figures we used the calculated molecular weights from sequencing to mark the labeled CNBr fragments.
The sequenced bands are marked in Fig. 6 and 7 .
The results of the sequencing of the different fragments are shown in Tab.
4 .
The overview of the determined α 1 -sequences shows, that the 3 H-meta-PAL specifically binds to the CNBr VIII = CNBr-2 fragment of the α 1 -subunit (Tab.
3 and 4 ) with the amino acids 236–290.

To more closely specify the binding site of the 3 H-meta-PAL, the single PTH-cycles from the sequencing of the CNBr VIII fragment (Fig. 7 and Tab.
4 ) were collected, lyophilised and the radioactivity of each fraction was counted.
Beside an unspecific "wash out", we determined a distinct increase of radioactivity in the cycles 3 and 8 (> 10-fold over basal measured activity), which correspond to the cysteines 238 and 243 (Fig. 8 ).
Thereby 3 H-meta-PAL is bound to sGC after irradiation by the cysteines 238 and 243 of the α 1 -subunit of the sGC (Fig. 9 ).
Course of the counted radioactivity of the single PTH-cycles of the sequencing of the CNBr VIII band.
Presented are the measured dpm (decompositions per min, counting time 2 h).
The pointed line represents the potential regression of the unspecific bound radioactivity, which is washed of the membrane during the first cycles ("wash out").

Invariant amino acids are shown in red on yelow background.
Amino acids building the consensus are shown in black on blue background and amino acids similar to the consensus are shown in black on red background.
The two labeled cysteines are marked with arrows.
The putative target sequence of bovine sGC differs from rat and human by the substitution of an arginine at position 238 instead of cysteine.
Therefore we investigated if BAY 41-2272 is active against the bovine enzyme or in isolated bovine vascular preparations.
We prepared crude sGC containing fraction from bovine lung by performing the homogenization and ion-exchange steps of the method described earlier [ 11 ] with a specific basal activity of 0.15 nmol/mg/min.
Using this preparation we examined the characteristic of sGC stimulation by BAY 41-2272 alone and in the presence of high concentrations of DEA/NO (Fig. 10 ).
This study shows that BAY 41-2272 stimulates directly the crude sGC-containing fraction from bovine lung in a concentration dependent manner.
In combination, BAY 41-2272 and the NO donor DEA/NO potentiates over a wide range of concentrations.
Stimulation of the crude sGC preparation from bovine lung by BAY 41-2272 in the absence and presence of DEA/NO (10 μM).
The specific activity of sGC preparation is expressed as x-fold stimulation vs. basal activity (basal activity in the presence of Mg 2+ : 152 nmol/mg/min).
The data presented represent means ± SEM, from 4 independent experiments performed in duplicate.
Discussion
To identify the binding site of the new class of direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators like YC-1 and the recently described more potent compound BAY 41-2272 [ 22 ] we focus in this paper in addition to results, already shown in Stasch et al.
[ 22 ], on the detailed description of the development of the first photoaffinity label by introducing a azidobenzoic acid at different positions (ortho-, meta-, and para-PAL) into the BAY 41-2272 core structure.
As shown, all tested photoaffinitylabels stimulate the purified enzyme with similar characteristics as YC-1.
sGC activity increases from the ortho- to the para- to the meta-PAL compound.
In contrast to the ortho-PAL compound, the meta- and para-PAL compounds show synergistic effects on sGC activity in combination with NO as described for YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 [ 11 , 22 ] (Tab.
1 ).
Therefore we conclude from these structure-activity-relationship, that the meta- and para-PALs in contrast to the ortho-PAL match structurally with the new binding site of the sGC, essentially regarding to the synergistic activation of sGC in combination with its physiological stimulator NO and thereby are useful tools in the identification of the new binding site in sGC.
In addition to Stasch et al.[ 22 ], we demonstrate here different potential PALs, which differ in their chemical structure and sGC stimulation characteristics.
In forward to avoid an unproductive destruction of the PAL during the labeling of the enzyme [ 34 ], stimulation of sGC was not only tested under standardized conditions [ 11 ] but also verified under modified conditions in the absence of DTT.
Even under this adapted conditions used for the labeling of the enzyme, the PAL compounds stimulate the purified enzyme with similar properties as YC-1 and BAY 41-2272.
Under these conditions meta-PAL reveals to be the most potent compound with the same characteristics on stimulation of sGC as YC-1 and BAY 41-2272.
As expected, meta-PAL shows no influence on the position of the Soret band of sGC both under basal and NO-stimulated conditions.
Thereby meta-PAL belongs to the new class of direct, NO-independent sGC stimulators, which stimulate sGC by a <START:DRUG> heme <END> -dependent mechanism without a direct interaction with the <START:DRUG> heme <END> -moiety [ 11 , 22 ].
Moreover we characterize the insertion characteristics of the meta-PAL.
Concomitant with the literature, our meta-PAL showed more potent NH- than CH-insertion qualities and thereby is qualified for protein conjugation reactions [ 35 ].
During irradiation with UV light (254 nm), under our adapted conditions the meta-PAL completely disintegrated within a time of maximal 18 min under release of nitrogen, detected by thin-layer-chromatography.
Beyond the fast reaction of azido compounds after irradiation with UV, the quality of a photoaffinitylabel depends on the stability of the compound and the radioactive label and of the covalent binding properties of the compound at or at least in the environment of the binding site [ 35 ].
Our compound is stable for several weeks stored at 70°C (data not shown).
Moreover, under reducing conditions, where the sGC is distinctly stimulated by the meta-PAL, and thereby the active conformation of the sGC should be provided, the 3 H-meta-PAL binds not only concentration-dependently but also specifically to the α 1 -subunit of the sGC.
Ideally, a classical receptor binding study would be the best aproach to characterize the specific as well as unspecific binding to sGC.
However, due to the physikochemical properties of the radioligand (e.g. low solubility, lipophilic character, low specific activity) and the difficulty that the receptor sGC is a soluble cytosolic enzyme, it was not possible to separate free and bound radioligand.
For this reasons we were not able to establish this study.
Binding to the α 1 -subunit of the enzyme was inert versus all used analytical steps (e.g. TCA precipitation, acid CNBr proteolyse, SDS-PAGE) and thereby underlines the quality of this new compound.
In a further study, the inhibition of this specifically binding of the 3 H-meta-PAL to the α 1 -subunit of the sGC by several sGC modulators was examined.
Thereby we could show that the 3 H-meta-PAL binds only after irradiation to the α 1 -subunit of the sGC, implicating that the 3 H-meta-PAL binds as a consequence of irradiation and not by an unspecific interaction to the enzyme.
After preincubation with the purified sGC, the unlabeled meta-PAL(10 and 100 μM) as well as YC-1 (100 μM) or BAY 41-2272 [ 22 ] inhibited the insertion of the 3 H-meta-PAL in the α 1 -subunit, underlining the specificity of the binding.
As shown in Fig. 4 , incubation with 200 μCi (125 μM) 3 H-meta-PAL in the presence of 100 μM unlabeled PAL showed only slight competition due to the small access of unlabeled compound.
For this reason further competition studies were performed with 12.5 μM 3 H-meta-PAL (Fig. 5 ).
In addition, the specific inhibitor of sGC, ODQ [ 36 ], strongly diminished the binding of the 3 H-meta-PAL to the α 1 -subunit.
In this case there could be detected an equivalent binding of the 3 H-meta-PAL both to the α 1 - and the β 1 -subunit.
It is described that ODQ inhibits sGC activity by oxidation of the <START:DRUG> heme <END> moiety from Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ or by competition with the NO binding site [ 37 , 38 ].
Therefore we propose that after interaction with ODQ the native <START:DRUG> heme <END> environment of the sGC is changed (e.g. by oxidation), destroying the binding site for direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators and therefore 3 H-meta-PAL unspecifically binds to both subunits of the sGC.
The slightly stronger labeling of the beta subunit would result in this context from the possible higher available concentration of free meta-PAL.
This explanation is underlined by the observation, that the <START:DRUG> heme <END> -depleted enzyme is insensitive towards stimulation by meta-PAL and other direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators like BAY 41-2272 or YC-1 [ 13 , 22 ].
Recently, Martin et al.
[ 46 ] showed that the stimulation of sGC by the new type of sGC stimulators like YC-1 has both <START:DRUG> heme <END> -dependent and <START:DRUG> heme <END> -independent components.
The stimulation of sGC by YC-1 is not completely blocked by ODQ, in particular in higher concentrations of sGC stimulators.
They conclude, that the binding of ODQ and YC-1 are not mutually exclusive processes and that their binding sites do not overlap.
These data corroborate our findings.
In addition, the 3 H-meta-PAL labeled sGC was fragmented by CNBr digest to identify the binding site of the 3 H-PAL at the α 1 -subunit more closely.
In this study, the chemical digest of the labeled sGC shows five highly labeled protein fragments on the Photo-Imaging-Plate of the gradient gel in the molecular range between 6.2 and 51.8 kDa and three highly labeled bands in the Photo-Imaging-Plate of the TRIS-Tricine-gel in the molecular range between 6.2 and 14.7 kDa.
These bands were identified and excised from the Coomassie-blue stained blot and sequencing of these bands showed, that they contain different fragments of both the α 1 - as the β 1 -subunit.
Because the 3 H-meta-PAL binds specifically to the α 1 -subunit of the sGC and thereby all identified β 1 -sequences could be discarded, the overview of the determined α 1 -sequences shows, that the 3 H-meta-PAL binds specifically to the CNBr VIII fragment, consisting of the amino acids 236–290 of the α 1 -subunit.
To more closely identify the binding site of the 3 H-meta-PAL, the single PTH-cycles from the sequencing of the CNBr VIII fragment were collected and the cysteines 238 and 243 of the α 1 -subunit were detected as binding sites of 3 H-meta-PAL.
As shown in Fig. 9 , these cysteines are conserved between the amino acid sequences of rat and human sGC [ 39 , 40 ] and this region could play an important role in regulation of sGC activity by this type of sGC.
However, the putative target of bovine sGC differs from rat and human by the substitution of an arginine at position 238 instead of cysteine.
As shown in previous studies with YC-1 [ 11 ] and verified in this study using crude bovine lung derived sGC extracts, we know that cysteine 238 is not essential for the stimulation of sGC by neither YC-1, nor BAY 41-2272, nor the PAL compound.
However, is must be considered that the potencies of BAY 41-2272 on human, rat and bovine sGC could be different.
For such comparison, the highly purified guanylate cyclases from these three species are needed.
The mechanism of sGC stimulation is rather more complicated than simple interaction with one or two amino acids since the <START:DRUG> heme <END> moiety bound to the His-105 of the β 1 -subunit is essential for activating the enzyme by YC-1, BAY 41-2272 and the PAL compound.
There is a distance of 9 Å between the photolabile azido group and the pharmacophore of the compound.
For this reason a covalent binding of the 3 H-PAL to reactive cysteines slightly outside the binding pocket would not be surprising.
Nevertheless, we assumed that Cys-238 and Cys-243 are in the direct region of access of 3 H-PAL because no other labeled amino acids have been detected and a diffusion over a wide distance can be excluded.
Recent studies with YC-1 implify that YC-1 binds to an allosteric site on sGC and thereby increases the maximal catalytic rate and sensitises the enzyme towards its gaseous activators NO and CO [ 11 , 13 ].
Studies about the kinetics and equilibra of sGC in the presence of YC-1 led to a mechanistic model, which attributes a crucial role to the proximal bond that connects the <START:DRUG> heme <END> <START:DRUG> iron <END> to the histidine 105 of the β 1 -subunit of sGC [ 41 , 42 ], but also requires protein control of the distal environment [ 43 ].
Firstly a small shift in the soret absorption feature of the sGC by YC-1 is observed.
It is discussed, that this small shift could be evoked by the replacement of the His-105 as the proximal <START:DRUG> heme <END> ligand by another base, either another amino acid side chain or even YC-1 itself [ 43 ].
In contrast to [ 21 ] who postulated the YC-1 binding site in analogy to the <START:DRUG> forskolin <END> binding site in the adenylate cyclase within the catalytic region of the α 1 - subunit of the sGC in the region of cysteine 596, we showed that the new generated photoaffinitylabel for direct and NO-independent sGC stimulators binds to the cysteines 238 and 243 in the N-terminus of the α 1 -subunit of the sGC and thereby in the near of the <START:DRUG> heme <END> binding region.
Hobbs [ 44 ] postulated an intramolecular sixth ligand of the <START:DRUG> heme <END> , which oscillates on and off the sixth coordinate, thereby conferring some sort of ligand specificity (i.e. NO and CO).
The binding of direct sGC stimulators to this site could block this intramolecular binding site and thereby simplify the binding of NO and CO to the enzyme.
This model is concomitant with the sensitising of the enzyme towards NO by this class of stimulators.
Very recently our findings have been supported [ 45 ] showing the important role of an additional <START:DRUG> heme <END> binding domain for sGC activation by the NO-independent sGC stimulator YC-1.
This domain is in the α-subunit in vicinity of the PAL labeled region.
Conclusion
In summary, using photoaffinity labelling, we identified the region of the cysteines 238 and 243 in the α 1 subunit of sGC as the target for NO-dependent sGC stimulators.
However, the relevance of the identified region as a regulatory unit remains to be confirmed by mutational analysis and co-crystallization studies.
Materials and Methods
Synthesis of YC-1 and the photoaffinity labels (PALs)
YC-1 ((3-(5-hydroxymethyl-2 furyl)-1-benzylindazole) was synthesized as described [ 23 ] and was used as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO.
Three PAL candidates (BAY 50-6038, BAY 50-8364 and BAY 51-9491) were synthetized from the common intermediate BAY 41-2272 [ 24 , 25 ] (Fig. 1 ).
The azide derivatives were obtained by deprotonation of the BAY 41-2272 primary amine with sodium hydride followed by reaction with the corresponding azide benzoyl chloride.
The ortho- and para-azidobenzoyl chlorides were synthesized by reaction of the corresponding ortho- and para-azidobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride.
In order to obtain the meta-azido derivative, the benzoyl chloride was synthesized in situ by reaction of the corresponding azidobenzoic acid [ 26 ] with 1-chloro-N,N-2-trimethylpropenylamine [ 27 ] (Fig. 1 ).
The synthesis of the corresponding [ 3 H]-BAY 51-9491 was accomplished as depicted in Fig. 2 .
Cyclization of the amidine with ethyl cyano(cyclopropyl)acetate [ 28 ] afforded the 6-amino-4-hydroxypyrimidine derivative, which was converted to the bromo precursor by reaction with phosphoroxide tribromide.
Br/ 3 H exchange followed by formation of the amide bond as detailed above yielded the [ 3 H]- BAY 51-9491.
Purification of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and determination of sGC activity
sGC was highly purified from a baculovirus / Sf9 expression system and enzyme activity was measured by formation of [ 32 P]-cGMP from [α- 32 P]-GTP modified according to Gerzer [ 29 ] in the presence of Mg 2+ as the divalent metal cation as described [ 11 ].
Incubations were performed in the presence and absence of 1 mM DTT.
All measurements were performed in duplicate and were repeated three times unless otherwise indicated.
The specific activity of sGC was calculated as nmol cGMP formed per mg protein per min incubation time.
For characterisation of the different sGC stimulators the specific activity of sGC was expressed as x-fold stimulation vs. specific basal activity.
The highest DMSO concentration in the test was 1% (v/v) and did not elicit any effect per se on cGMP production.
Spectroscopic studies
UV/Vis spectra were recorded from 300 to 600 nm on a DU 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Munich, Germany).
NO was introduced via an aqueous solution of DEA/NO.
A 100 mM stock solution of meta-PAL in DMSO was prepared and added in a final concentration of 10 μM, resulting in a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% (v/v), which does not alter the properties of the enzyme.
Evaluation of CH- and NH-insertion qualities of the meta-PAL
Meta-PAL (BAY 51-9491) was dissolved in diethylamine, dipropylamine, piperidine, <START:DRUG> toluene <END> , or ethylbenzole in a concentration of 1 mg/ml and degassed by three thaw-freeze-cycles.
1 ml of each solution was given in a well of a 24 well PET plate (Wallac, Turku, Finland) and irradiated with a UV hand lamp at 254 or 365 nm in a distance of 3 cm for 2 h (254 nm: N8K UV 254 nm hand lamp, Benda, Wiesloch, Germany; 365 nm: Universal UV lamp, CAMAG, Berlin, Germany).
Solutions were evaporated in a Speed Vac (Bachofer, Reutlingen, Germany) and qualitatively and quantitatively analysed by LC / MS (column: symmetry C18, 2.1 × 150 mm; eluent: A: acetonitrile, B: 0.6 g HCl (30%) in 1 l MilliQ water; gradient: time 0: 10% A and 90% B flow: 0.6 ml/min, time 4 min: 90% A and 10% B flow: 0.6 ml/min, time 9.5 min: 10% A and 90% B flow: 0.8 ml/min; at 50°C).
Resulting products were considered as NH- or CH-insertion products if their molecular weights correspond to the calculated weight of the insertion product and were given as % peak area of total peak area.
To evaluate the irradiation time required for N2 degradation, meta-PAL (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in PAL buffer (final 50 mM TEA/HCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM cGMP, 3 mM MgCl2, 200 μM GTP, pH 7.4) in the absence and presence of 0.3 mg/ml glucose oxidase as model protein and irradiated as described at 254 nm.
Every minute an aliquot was removed and fragmented compounds were separated from meta-PAL by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase: silicagel 60 layered glass plate 5 × 10 cm (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); mobile phase: acetoacetate).
Labeling of purified sGC
12.5 or 25 μg sGC (purity about 91%) were dissolved in PAL buffer (final 50 mM TEA/HCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM cGMP, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 200 μM GTP, pH 7.4) and incubated with 200, 20 or 2 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL (specific activity: 7.9 Ci/mmol ≅ 0.29 MBq/nmol) in the presence or absence of 100 μM meta-PAL in a volume of 80 or 100 μl in a 24 well PET plate (5 min, 37°C).
Samples were irradiated at 254 nm (distance 3 cm, 20°C, 15 min) and the reaction was stopped by adding 20 or 25 μl SDS-containing stop solution (312.5 mM TRIS/HCl / 10% (w/v) SDS / 50% (v/v) glycerine / 250 mM DDT / 0.025% (w/v) bromphenolblue, pH 6.8) and heating (5 min at 80°C).
In a further study 12.5 μg sGC were incubated with 20 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL in the presence and absence of the different sGC modulators as indicated, irradiated and stopped as described.
For controls 12.5 μg sGC were incubated with 20 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL without irradiation and 12.5 μg glucose oxidase were irradiated as described in the presence of 20 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL.
Separation was performed on a 7,5% SDS-PAGE (PROTEAN II cell, Bio-Rad, München, Germany) using a modified Laemmli method [ 30 ].
After electrophoresis, proteins were fixed for 20 min in methanol/ <START:DRUG> acetic acid <END> / MilliQ water (30/10/60), dried and exposed to BAS-TR 20/25 Imaging-Plates (Ray Test, Straubenhardt, Germany) for 15 days as described [ 31 ].
After exposure, the imaging plates were scanned (BAS 5000 Scanner, Ray Test, Straubenhardt, Germany).
Evaluation was performed by visual classification of radiographic intensities, displayed by use of pseudo-colours, starting with blue for lowest detectable concentrations up to red for highest concentrations as shown in each figure by a gradation bar.
CNBr fragmentation of labeled sGC
200 μg sGC were labeled as described with 1600 μCi 3 H-meta-PAL, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of final 10% TCA.
The labeled protein was precipitated (4°C, 30 min), centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 30 min; Centrifuge 5415C, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and washed two times with ice cold <START:DRUG> ethanol <END> :ether (1:1).
The protein pellet was dissolved in <START:DRUG> formic acid <END> (70%) and reacted with a few crystals of CNBr in the dark (24 h, 20°C) under oxygen-free nitrogen.
After evaporation in a Speed Vac (Bachofer, Reutlingen, Germany) for three times after the addition of 1 ml MilliQ water, the pellet was dissolved in 100 μl sample buffer (62.5 mM TRIS/HCl / 2% (w/v) SDS / 10% (v/v) glycerine / 50 mM DDT / 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenolblue, pH 6.8), heated (5 min, 80°C) and the protein fragments were separated on a 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE or a 16.5% TRIS-Tricine-gel [ 32 ], respectively.
The digested protein fragments were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Trans-Blot ® Electrophoretic Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad, München, Germany) [ 33 ], stained with 0.025% (w/v) Coomassie-blue-R / 40% (v/v) MeOH and destained in 50% (v/v) MeOH.
Dried membranes were exposed to BAS-TR 20/25 Imaging-Plates (Ray Test, Straubenhardt, Germany) for 6 h (10–20% gradient gel blot) without or for 48 h with a screen of metal folio for contamination monitors (0.9 mg/cm 2 Steiner, Erndtebrück-Schameder, Germany) (16.5% TRIS-Tricine-gel blot) [ 31 ].
After exposure, the Imaging Plates were scanned and evaluation was performed as described above.
N-terminal sequence analysis
N-terminal sequence analyses were performed using the gas-liquid-solid-phase protein sequencer Procise™ from Applied Biosystems (Forster City, CA., U.S.A.).
The sequencer program for blot sequencing was used according to the manufacturer s standard protocol (User's manual set Procise™, 1994; Applied Biosystems, Forster City, USA).
The detection of PTH-amino acids was performed on-line using an RP-18-PTH-column (220 mm × 2 mm, 5 μm-material) from Applied Biosytems.
The PTH-amino acids were identified and quantified by a 50 pmol PTH-standard.
The data were collected and integrated using the sequencer data system (Protein sequencing protocols; ed.
Bryan John Smith; Humana Press INC.; Totowa, New Jersey).
Sequence analysis
PVDF-membrane pieces were washed twice with 100 μl 50% (v/v) MeOH before sequencing.
The cyanogen bromide fragment CNBrVIII was sequenced over 60 cycles using the sequencer program for blot sequencing.
The single PTH-amino acids were collected (fraction collector Superrac 2211, Pharmacia) lyophilised, dissolved in acetonitril and MeOH and transferred to Combust-Cones, filled with two Combust-Pads (Packard, Illinois, USA).
The radioactivity of each fraction was determined after combustion (Oxidizer model 307, Oximate 80, Packard, Illinois, USA) and dissolution of resulting gases in 15 ml scintillator (Monophase Scintillator, Packard) with a counting time of 2 h in a liquid scintillation counter (LS-6500, Beckmann, München, Germany).
