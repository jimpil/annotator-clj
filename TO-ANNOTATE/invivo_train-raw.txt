Pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir and quinine in healthy volunteers following concurrent administration.
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir and quinine in healthy volunteers.
Ten healthy volunteers were each given 600-mg single oral doses of quinine alone, ritonavir alone (200 mg every 12 h for 9 days), and quinine in combination with ritonavir, in a three-period pharmacokinetic nonrandomized sequential design study.
Quinine was co-administered with the 15th dose of ritonavir.
Blood samples collected at predetermined time intervals were analysed for ritonavir, quinine and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method.
Downward dosage adjustment of quinine appears necessary when concurrently administered with ritonavir.
Concurrent ritonavir administration resulted in about fourfold increases in both the C(max) and AUC(T) [C(max) 2.79 +/- 0.22 vs. 10.72 +/- 0.32 mg l(-1), 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.81, 8.04; AUC 50.06 +/- 2.52 vs. 220.47 +/- 6.68 mg h(-1) l(-1), 95% CI 166.3, 175.3], a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the elimination half-life (11.15 +/- 0.80 vs. 13.37 +/- 0.33 h, 95% CI 1.64, 2.77) and about a 4.5-fold decrease in CL/F (12.01 +/- 0.61 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.09 l h(-1)) of quinine.
Also, with ritonavir, there was a pronounced reduction of AUC(metabolite)/AUC(unchanged drug) ratio of quinine (1.35 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.02) along with a marked decrease in C(max) (1.80 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.09 mg l(-1)) and AUC(0-48h) (62.80 +/- 6.30 vs. 25.61 +/- 2.44 mg h(-1) l(-1)) of the metabolite.
Similarly, quinine caused modest but significant increases (P < 0.01) in the C(max), AUC and elimination T((1/2)) of ritonavir.
Phase I study of valspodar (PSC-833) with mitoxantrone and etoposide in refractory and relapsed pediatric acute leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.
Valspodar, a non-immunosuppressive analog of cylosporine, is a potent P-glycoprotein (MDR1) inhibitor.
As MDR1-mediated efflux of chemotherapeutic agents from leukemic blasts may contribute to drug resistance, a phase 1 study of valspodar combined with mitoxantrone and etoposide in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias was performed.
Patients received a valspodar-loading dose (2 mg/kg) followed by a 5-day continuous valspodar infusion (8, 10, 12.5, or 15 mg/kg/day) combined with lower than standard doses of mitoxantrone and etoposide.
The valspodar dose was escalated using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design.
Twenty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity and 20 for response.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of valspodar was 12.5 mg/kg/day, combined with 50% dose-reduced mitoxantrone and etoposide.
Dose-limiting toxicities included stomatitis, ataxia, and bone marrow aplasia.
Three of 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had complete responses while no patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had an objective response.
In vitro studies demonstrated P-glycoprotein expression on the blasts of 5 of 14 patients, although only 1 had inhibition of rhodamine efflux by valspodar.
While this regimen was tolerable, responses in this heavily pretreated population were limited to a subset of patients with ALL.
The clearance of mitoxantrone and etoposide was decreased by 64% and 60%, respectively, when combined with valspodar.
Ketoconazole and rifampin significantly affect the pharmacokinetics, but not the safety or QTc interval, of casopitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist.
Casopitant, an antiemetic, is a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Three phase 1 studies with 131 healthy subjects examined the impact of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (ketoconazole) and inducer (rifampin) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of casopitant.
Oral casopitant was administered alone (study 1, 100-mg single dose; study 2, 150 mg on day 1, 50 mg on days 2 and 3; study 3, 150-mg single dose) with either 400 mg daily of oral ketoconazole or 600 mg daily of oral rifampin.
Neither safety signals nor prolongation of Fredericia-corrected QT was observed at these increased exposures in study 2.
These clinical studies confirmed the role of CYP3A in the metabolism and disposition of casopitant.
Coadministration of casopitant with strong inhibitors of CYP3A is likely to increase plasma exposure of casopitant, whereas coadministration with strong inducers of CYP3A is likely to decrease casopitant exposure and compromise efficacy.
Ketoconazole increased the maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration time curve to the last sampling time, t (AUC(0-t)) of single-dose casopitant 2.7-fold and 12-fold and increased the C(max) of 3-day casopitant 2.5-fold on day 1 and 2.9-fold on day 3, whereas AUC((0-tau)) increased 4.3-fold on day 1 and 5.8-fold on day 3.
Repeat-dose rifampin reduced the C(max) and AUC((0-t)) of casopitant 96% and 90%, respectively.
A phase I dose escalation and pharmacokinetic study of vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584) in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.
To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for weekly paclitaxel administered in combination with daily vatalanib (PTK787/ZK 222584, PTK/ZK) and assess for a drug-drug interaction.
Patients were treated with escalating doses of weekly paclitaxel (75-85 mg/m(2)), and daily TK/ZK (250-1,000 mg).
During the first cycle only, paclitaxel was given on days 1 and 15, and PTK/ZK on days 3-28.
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on cycle 1 days 1 and 15 for paclitaxel, and on cycle 1 day 15 for PTK/ZK.
Therapy was given until disease progression.
Twenty-seven patients were accrued to four dose levels.
Two of five patients treated with paclitaxel 85 mg/m(2) and PTK/ZK 1,000 mg had Grade 3 transaminase elevation as dose-limiting toxicity.
Activity included one partial response and 11 patients with stable disease > or =4 months, including patients previously treated with paclitaxel.
The MTD for weekly paclitaxel plus daily PTK/ZK is 75 mg/m(2) and 750 mg.
This combination was well tolerated with evidence of anti-cancer activity and provides guidance for phase 2 planning.
Paired PK analyses demonstrated a significant increase in paclitaxel clearance on day 15 (p = 0.006).
PK analysis revealed a significant drug-drug interaction, with an increase in paclitaxel clearance.
Effects of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously and orally administered oxycodone.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP34A) inhibitor itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally and intravenously administered oxycodone.
Twelve healthy subjects were administered 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally for 5 days in a four-session paired cross-over study.
On day 4, oxycodone was administered intravenously (0.1 mg/kg) in the first part of the study and orally (10 mg) in the second part.
Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 h, and pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated.
Itraconazole increased the exposure to oxycodone by inhibiting its CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation.
The clinical use of itraconazole in patients receiving multiple doses of oxycodone for pain relief may increase the risk of opioid-associated adverse effects.
Itraconazole decreased plasma clearance (Cl) and increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-infinity) of intravenous oxycodone by 32 and 51%, respectively (P<0.001) and increased the AUC(0-infinity) of orally administrated oxycodone by 144% (P<0.001).
Most of the pharmacokinetic changes in oral oxycodone were seen in the elimination phase, with modest effects by itraconazole on its peak concentration, which was increased by 45% (P=0.009).
The AUC(0-48) of noroxycodone was decreased by 49% (P<0.001) and that of oxymorphone was increased by 359% (P<0.001) after the administration of oral oxycodone.
The pharmacologic effects of oxycodone were enhanced by itraconazole only modestly.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between oral lovastatin and verapamil in healthy subjects: role of P-glycoprotein inhibition by lovastatin.
Lovastatin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme.
Verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4.
It is therefore likely that lovastatin can alter the absorption and metabolism of verapamil.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared in 14 healthy male Korean volunteers (age range 22-28 years) who had been administered verapamil (60 mg) orally in the presence or absence of oral lovastatin (20 mg).
The design of the experiment was a standard 2 x 2 crossover model in random order.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil were significantly altered by the co-administration of lovastatin compared to the control.
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) and the peak plasma concentration of verapamil were significantly increased by 62.8 and 32.1%, respectively.
Consequently, the relative bioavailability of verapamil was also significantly increased (by 76.5%).
The (AUC (0-infinity)) of norverapamil and the terminal half-life of verapamil did not significantly changed with lovastatin coadministration.
The metabolite-parent ratio was significantly reduced (29.2%) in the presence of lovastatin.
Lovastatin increased the absorption of verapamil by inhibiting P-gp and inhibited the first-pass metabolism of verapamil by inhibiting CYP3A4 in the intestine and/or liver in humans.
Inhibition of oral midazolam clearance by boosting doses of ritonavir, and by 4,4-dimethyl-benziso-(2H)-selenazine (ALT-2074), an experimental catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: * The viral protease inhibitor ritonavir is known to inhibit clearance of intravenous midazolam.
* ALT-2074, a catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase, inhibits human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms in vitro.
* Short-term administration of low-dose ritonavir increases area under the plasma concentration curve following oral midazolam by a factor of 28.
* Therefore ritonavir is an appropriate positive control inhibitor for clinical drug interaction studies involving CYP3A substrates.
* Midazolam clearance is weakly inhibited by ALT-2074, consistent with its in vitro profile.
We evaluated whether 'boosting' doses of ritonavir can serve as a positive control inhibitor for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies involving cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).
The study also determined whether 4,4-dimethyl-benziso-(2H)-selenazine (ALT-2074), an investigational organoselenium compound that acts as a catalytic mimic of glutathione oxidase, inhibits CYP3A metabolism in vivo.
Thirteen healthy volunteers received single 3-mg oral doses of midazolam on three occasions: in the control condition, during co-treatment with low-dose ritonavir (three oral doses of 100 mg over 24 h), and during co-treatment with ALT-2074 (three oral doses of 80 mg over 24 h).
Low-dose ritonavir produces extensive CYP3A inhibition exceeding that of ketoconazole (typically 10- to 15-fold midazolam AUC enhancement), and is a suitable positive control index inhibitor for drug-drug interaction studies.
ALT-2074 inhibits CYP3A metabolism to a small degree that is of uncertain clinical importance.
Ritonavir increased mean (+/-SE) total area under the curve (AUC) for midazolam by a factor of 28.4 +/- 4.2 (P < 0.001), and reduced oral clearance to 4.2 +/- 0.5% of control (P < 0.001).
In contrast, ALT-2074 increased midazolam AUC by 1.25 +/- 0.11 (P < 0.05), and reduced oral clearance to 88 +/- 8% of control.
Investigation of the pharmacokinetic interactions of deferasirox, a once-daily oral iron chelator, with midazolam, rifampin, and repaglinide in healthy volunteers.
Deferasirox, a newly developed iron chelator, was coadministered orally with either a known inducer of drug metabolism or with cosubstrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) to characterize the potential for drug-drug interactions.
In the induction assessment, single-dose deferasirox pharmacokinetics were obtained in the presence and absence of a repeated-dose regimen of rifampin.
In the CYP3A interaction evaluation, midazolam and its active hydroxylated metabolite were assessed after single doses of midazolam in the presence and absence of steady-state concentrations of deferasirox.
To test for interaction at the level of CPY2C8, single-dose repaglinide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were determined with and without repeated-dose administration of deferasirox.
Specific patient prescribing recommendations were established when coadministering deferasirox with midazolam, repaglinide, and rifampin.
These recommendations may also apply to other substrates of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8 or potent inducers of glucuronidation.
After rifampin, a significant reduction (44%) in plasma exposure (AUC) to deferasirox was observed.
Upon coadministration of midazolam, there was a modest reduction of up to 22% in midazolam exposure (AUC, C(max)), suggesting a modest induction of CYP3A4/5 by deferasirox.
Deferasirox caused increases in repaglinide plasma C(max) and AUC of 1.5-fold to over 2-fold, respectively, with little change in blood glucose measures.
Inhibition of the active principle of the weak opioid tilidine by the triazole antifungal voriconazole.
To investigate in vivo the influence of the potent CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects of tilidine.
Sixteen healthy volunteers received voriconazole (400 mg) or placebo together with a single oral dose of tilidine (100 mg).
Blood samples and urine were collected for 24 h and experimental pain was determined by using the cold pressor test.
Noncompartimental analysis was performed to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of tilidine, nortilidine and voriconazole, whereas pharmacodynamic parameters were analysed by nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman).
After voriconazole much lower serum concentrations of bisnortilidine were observed.
Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events was almost doubled after voriconazole and tilidine.
Voriconazole caused a 20-fold increase in exposition of tilidine in serum [AUC 1250.8 h*ng ml(-1), 95% confidence interval (CI) 1076.8, 1424.9 vs. 61 h*ng ml(-1), 95% CI 42.6, 80.9; P < 0.0001], whereas the AUC of nortilidine also increased 2.5-fold.
The onset of analgesic activity occurred later with voriconazole, which is in agreement with the prolonged t(max) of nortilidine (0.78 h, 95% CI 0.63, 0.93 vs. 2.5 h, 95% CI 1.85, 3.18; P < 0.0001) due to the additional inhibition of nortilidine metabolism to bisnortilidine.
After voriconazole the AUC under the pain withdrawal-time curve was reduced compared with placebo (149 s h(-1), 95% CI 112, 185 vs. 175 s h(-1), 95% CI 138, 213; P < 0.016), mainly due to the shorter withdrawal time 0.75 h after tilidine administration.
Voriconazole significantly inhibited the sequential metabolism of tilidine with increased exposure of the active nortilidine.
Clarithromycin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, greatly increases exposure to oral S-ketamine.
Oral ketamine is used as an adjuvant in the treatment of refractory neuropathic and cancer-related pain.
Drug interactions may alter the analgesic or other effects of ketamine.
The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme inhibition with clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral S-ketamine in a randomized controlled cross-over study with two phases.
Ten healthy subjects were pre-treated with oral clarithromycin or placebo for 4 days.
On day 4, they ingested an oral dose of 0.2mg/kg of S-ketamine syrup.
Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were measured for 24h.
Analgesic effects were evaluated in a cold pressor test and psychomotor effects were followed for 12h.
This increase is reflected as modest changes in behavioral effects of oral S-ketamine.
Clarithromycin increased the mean C(max) of ketamine by 3.6-fold (p<0.001) and the mean AUC(0-infinity) of ketamine by 2.6-fold (p=0.001).
The relative amount of the CYP3A dependent metabolite norketamine was decreased by 54% by clarithromycin (p=0.004).
Self-rated drug effect of S-ketamine was enhanced by clarithromycin (p<0.05) but other behavioral effects or cold pain scores were not affected.
Clarithromycin strongly increases plasma concentrations of oral S-ketamine probably by inhibiting its CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation.
Time-dependent inhibitory effects of (1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,18E,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-1,14-dihydroxy-12-(E)-2- [(1R,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]-1-methylvinyl-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-17-(2-oxopropyl)-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo [22.3.1.0(4.9)]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetrone (FK1706), a novel nonimmunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, on CYP3A4/5 activity in humans in vivo and in vitro.
We investigated the inhibitory effects of (1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,18E,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-1, 14-dihydroxy-12-(E)-2- [(1R,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]-1-methylvinyl-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl-17-(2-oxopropyl)-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo [22.3.1.0(4.9)]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16-tetrone (FK1706), a novel nonimmunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, on CYP3A4/5 in in vitro and in vivo settings.
First, the inhibitory effects of FK1706 (preincubation dependence, inactivation rate estimation, and reversibility) were tested using human liver microsomes.
Second, the effect of repeated oral doses of FK1706 (60 mg q.d. for 14 days) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single oral 2-mg dose) was tested in healthy volunteers.
Finally, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were performed.
In vitro experiments showed that FK1706 inhibited CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent and irreversible manner.
The in vitro maximum inactivation rate constant (k(inact)) and concentration of inhibitor that gave half-maximal k(inact) (K(I)) were estimated to be 10.1 h(-1) and 2050 ng/ml, respectively.
In conclusion, FK1706 weakly or moderatelyinhibited the activity of CYP3A4/5 in vitro and vivo at the tested dose.
The model developed here would be helpful in predicting drug-drug interactions and in the design of dose regimens that avoid drug-drug interactions.
In the clinical study, FK1706 produced a 2-fold increase in the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) of midazolam.
A pharmacokinetic model developed for this study, which described the time course of concentrations of both FK1706 and midazolam and incorporated CYP3A4/5 inactivation in the liver and intestine, successfully predicted the change in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam using in vitro k(inact) and K(I) values (1.66- to 2.81-fold increases in AUC predicted) and estimated the in vivo inactivation rate to be 0.00404 to 0.0318 h(-1) x ml/ng.
Effects of the P-glycoprotein inducer carbamazepine on fexofenadine pharmacokinetics.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of carbamazepine, a P-glycoprotein inducer, on fexofenadine pharmacokinetics.
Twelve healthy Japanese volunteers (nine males and three females) were enrolled in this study after giving written informed consent.
This randomized open-label study consisted of two phases (control and 7-day treatment) with a 2-week washout period.
In the control phase, volunteers received 60 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride after an overnight fast.
In the treatment phase, carbamazepine was dosed 100 mg three times daily (for a total daily dose of 300 mg) for 7 days, and on Day 7, a single 60-mg dose of fexofenadine was coadministered with a 100-mg dose of carbamazepine.
The plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of fexofenadine were measured for 24 hours after dosing.
Carbamazepine pretreatment significantly altered fexofenadine pharmacokinetics, decreasing the mean (+/- standard deviation) peak plasma concentration from 176.6 (+/- 82.1) ng/mL to 103.2 (+/- 33.6) ng/mL (P < 0.01) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 1058.4 (+/- 528.7) ng/h/mL to 604.8 (+/- 255.9) ng/h/mL (P < 0.01) without changing the elimination half-life.
Relatively, carbamazepine significantly reduced the amount of fexofenadine excreted into the urine from 8.1 (+/- 2.1) mg to 4.5 (+/- 1.4) mg (P < 0.001), although the renal clearance of fexofenadine remained constant between the two study phases.
Thus, this study indicates that carbamazepine significantly decreases fexofenadine plasma concentrations, probably as a result of P-glycoprotein induction in the small intestine.
Carbamazepine treatment, therefore, is of moderate clinical significance for patients receiving fexofenadine.
Effect of saquinavir-ritonavir on cytochrome P450 3A4 activity in healthy volunteers using midazolam as a probe.
To investigate the inhibitory potential of multiple doses of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir on the pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 model substrate.
Prospective, open-label, one-sequence, two-period crossover study.
Clinical pharmacology unit in the United Kingdom.
Eighteen healthy adult male and female volunteers (median age 37.5 yrs).
Intervention.
A single oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg was administered on day 1.
A second dose was administered on day 16, after 14 days of oral saquinavir 1000 mg-ritonavir 100 mg twice/day.
Serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were determined when midazolam was given alone (day 1) and after coadministration with saquinavir-ritonavir for 14 days (day 16).
Two weeks of treatment with saquinavir-ritonavir resulted in a 4.3-fold increase in maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and a 12.4-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) for midazolam.
Midazolam's half-life increased from 4.7 to 14.9 hours.
Concomitant reductions for 1'-hydroxymidazolam were approximately 7-fold for C(max) and 2-fold for AUC(0-infinity).
The 1'-hydroxymidazolam AUC(0-infinity):midazolam AUC(0-infinity) ratio was only 1% during coadministration of midazolam with saquinavir-ritonavir compared with 33% for midazolam alone.
Adverse-event reports indicated that the combination of saquinavir, ritonavir, and midazolam was well tolerated but resulted in prolonged sedation.
Administration of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir markedly increased the exposure of midazolam by inhibiting its metabolism, confirming that the combination of saquinavir and ritonavir at steady state strongly inhibits CYP3A4 activity.
Effects of mexiletine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, on tizanidine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The aim of this study was to determine whether mexiletine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tizanidine.
The pharmacokinetics of tizanidine were examined in an open-label study in 12 healthy participants after a single dose of tizanidine (2 mg) with and without mexiletine coadministration (50 mg, 3 times as a pretreatment for a day and 2 times on the study day).
Of the 15 patients treated with tizanidine and mexiletine, 4 suffered tizanidine-induced adverse effects such as drowsiness and dry mouth in the retrospective survey.
Compared with tizanidine alone, mexiletine coadministration increased the peak plasma concentration (1.8 +/- 0.8 vs 5.3 +/- 1.8 ng/mL), area under the curve (4.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.4 +/- 6.5 ng x h/mL), and the half-life (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 1.8 +/- 0.7 h) of tizanidine, respectively (P < .05).
reduction in systolic blood pressure (-10 +/- 8 vs -24 +/- 7 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (-10 +/- 7 vs -18 +/- 8 mm Hg) after tizanidine administration was also significantly enhanced by coadministration of mexiletine (P < .01).
Present results suggested that coadministration of mexiletine increased blood tizanidine concentrations and enhanced tizanidine pharmacodynamics in terms of reduction in blood pressure and adverse symptoms.
Effect of telithromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone.
The aim of this study is to determine whether the inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activity with telithromycin affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered oxycodone in a randomized 2-phase crossover study.
Eleven healthy subjects were pretreated with 800 mg of oral telithromycin or placebo for 4 days.
On day 3, they ingested 10 mg of immediate-release oxycodone.
Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 hours, and pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated.
reduction of oxycodone dose by 25% to 50% followed by readjustment according to the clinical response might be appropriate.
Telithromycin increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of oxycodone by 80% (P < .001) and reduced the AUC(0-infinity) of noroxycodone by 46% (P < .001).
Most of the pharmacokinetic changes were seen in the elimination phase, with little effect by telithromycin on the peak concentration of oxycodone.
Pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were modestly enhanced by telithromycin.
In conclusion, telithromycin clearly reduces the N-demethylation of oxycodone to noroxycodone by inhibiting the CYP450 3A4 enzyme.
The use of telithromycin in patients receiving multiple doses of oxycodone for pain relief may increase the risk of opioid adverse effects.
Pharmacokinetics of concurrent administration of fosamprenavir and atazanavir without ritonavir in human immunodeficiency virus-negative subjects.
To quantify the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and atazanavir (administered as the prodrug fosamprenavir) alone and in combination in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative subjects.
Randomized, open-label, three-way crossover study.
Research facility.
Eleven men and 10 women who were seronegative for HIV.
Subjects were randomized to 14-day treatment periods of fosamprenavir 1400 mg once/day, atazanavir 400 mg once/day, or fosamprenavir 1400 mg plus atazanavir 400 mg once/day; after a washout period of at least 21 days between each treatment, they received the other two treatments.
Subjects underwent 24-hour pharmacokinetic sampling at baseline and on day 14 of each treatment period.
Primary outcome measures were area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C(max)) for amprenavir and atazanavir.
When fosamprenavir was given alone, the geometric mean of amprenavir's AUC was 20.2 microg x hour/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.1-21.2 microg x hr/ml).
Adverse events were assessed at each study visit and 1 month after the subjects completed the three treatments.
Both drugs were well tolerated.
One serious adverse event (grade 3 acute pancreatitis) occurred and resolved without further incident.
This dosing scheme is not a recommended combination of dual, fully active protease inhibitors.
Atazanavir significantly enhanced the exposure of amprenavir.
When given in combination with atazanavir, amprenavir had an AUC of 39.8 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 38.7-40.9 microg x hr/ml).
Similarly, the C(max) for amprenavir increased from 4193 ng/ml (95% CI 3927-4459 ng/ml) to 6621 ng/ml (95% CI 6427-6814 ng/ml) when given in combination with atazanavir.
In contrast, AUC and C(max) for atazanavir significantly decreased when atazanavir was coadministered with fosamprenavir; AUC decreased from 17.6 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 16.6-18.7 microg x hr/ml) to 11.8 microg x hour/ml (95% CI 11.3-12.3 microg x hr/ml), and C(max) decreased from 2507 ng/ml (95% CI 2379-2635 ng/ml) to 1832 ng/ml (95% CI 1752-1911 ng/ml).
Atazanavir 400 mg/day plus fosamprenavir 1400 mg/day significantly decreased concentrations of atazanavir compared with standard dosing regimens of each drug alone.
Effects of oral posaconazole on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir alone and with ritonavir or with efavirenz in healthy adult volunteers.
Patients with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk for opportunistic fungal infections.
These patients may require concomitant treatment with antiretrovirals and azole antifungals, and interactions between these classes of drugs should be anticipated.
A phase 1, open-label, randomized, crossover, drug interaction study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic effects of coadministration of posaconazole (400 mg twice daily), with atazanavir (ATV) (300 mg/d alone) and with ritonavir (100 mg/d) or with efavirenz (400 mg/d) in healthy volunteers.
Most subjects who received ATV (with and without ritonavir) and posaconazole experienced clinically relevant increases in total bilirubin.
Frequent monitoring of adverse events and toxicity related to antiviral exposure is recommended in the event of coadministration of posaconazole and ATV with or without ritonavir.
In addition, because of decreased posaconazole exposure, coadministration with efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to patients outweighs the risk.
Posaconazole increased maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ATV by 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively.
Posaconazole increased ATV Cmax and AUC when administered with ritonavir by 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively.
Coadministration of posaconazole and efavirenz resulted in clinically relevant decreases of posaconazole Cmax and AUC of approximately45% and 50%, respectively.
Enantioselective disposition of fexofenadine with the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil.
The aim was to compare possible effects of verapamil, as a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of each fexofenadine enantiomer, as a P-gp substrate.
Thirteen healthy Japanese volunteers (10 male and three female) were enrolled.
In a randomized, two-phase, crossover design, verapamil was dosed 80 mg three times daily (with total daily doses of 240 mg) for 6 days, and on day 6, a single 120-mg dose of fexofenadine was administered along with an 80-mg dose of verapamil.
Subsequently, fexofenadine was administered alone after a 2-week wash-out period.
The plasma concentrations of fexofenadine enantiomers were measured up to 24 h after dosing.
During the control phase, the mean AUC(0-infinity) of S(-)- and R(+)-fexofenadine was 700 ng h(-1) ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI) 577, 823] and 1202 ng h(-1) ml(-1) (95% CI 1007, 1396), respectively, with a significant difference (P < 0.001).
Verapamil had a greater effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of S(-)-fexofenadine compared with those of the R(+)-enantiomer, and increased AUC(0-infinity) of S(-)-fexofenadine and R(+)-fexofenadine by 3.5-fold (95% CI of differences 1.9, 5.1; P < 0.001) and by 2.2-fold (95% CI of differences 1.7, 3.0; P < 0.001), respectively.
The R/S ratio for the AUC(0-infinity) was reduced from 1.76 to 1.32 (P < 0.001) by verapamil treatments.
This study indicates that P-gp plays a key role in the stereoselectivity of fexofenadine pharmacokinetics, since the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine enantiomers were altered by the P-gp inhibitor verapamil, and this effect was greater for S-fexofenadine compared with R-fexofenadine.
Influence of darunavir coadministration on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients: a population approach.
The influence of ritonavir-boosted darunavir coadministration on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was investigated in HIV-infected patients using a population-based approach.
The population was composed of 51 patients (89 samples; 42 patients treated with an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nine patients treated with a regimen containing a combination of nevirapine and darunavir).
A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was fitted to the data using nonmem version V (GloboMax, Ellicott City, MD, USA).
Relationships were established between nevirapine clearance (Cl) and age (CL/F=2.42+47.2/age, where F denotes bioavailability) and between nevirapine volume of distribution (V(d)) and the presence of darunavir in the antiretroviral regimen [V(d)/F=38.0+75.0 (1 - darunavir coadministration), where darunavir coadministration is 1 for patients treated with a combination of nevirapine and darunavir and 0 for other patients].
According to this final model, a significant decrease in the means of CL/F (3.84 +/- 0.92 vs. 2.76 +/- 1.00 L/h; P<0.05) and V(d)/F (93.2 +/- 31.10 vs. 39.8 +/- 6.97 L; P<0.0001) and an increase in the mean of nevirapine trough plasma concentrations (3.68 +/- 1.69 vs. 5.35 +/- 3.20 mg/L; P<0.05) are observed if nevirapine is used in combination with darunavir.
These results suggest that nevirapine exposure is increased when nevirapine is administered in combination with darunavir and that therapeutic drug monitoring of nevirapine should be performed if this antiretroviral regimen is considered.
Rifampin greatly reduces the plasma concentrations of intravenous and oral oxycodone.
Oxycodone is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A and 2D6 enzymes.
Rifampin is a strong inducer of several drug-metabolizing enzymes.
The authors studied the interaction of rifampin with oxycodone.
Their hypothesis was that rifampin enhances the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of oxycodone and attenuates its pharmacologic effect.
The protocol was a four-session, paired crossover.
Twelve volunteers were given 600 mg oral rifampin or placebo once daily for 7 days.
Oxycodone was given on day 6.
In the first part of the study, 0.1 mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride was given intravenously.
In the second part of the study, 15 mg oxycodone hydrochloride was given orally.
Concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone were determined for 48 h. Psychomotor effects were characterized for 12 h by several visual analog scales.
Analgesic effects were characterized by measuring the heat pain threshold and cold pain sensitivity.
To maintain adequate analgesia, dose adjustment of oxycodone may be necessary, when used concomitantly with rifampin.
Rifampin decreased the area under the oxycodone concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral oxycodone by 53% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.001).
Oral bioavailability of oxycodone was decreased from 69% to 21% (P < 0.001).
Rifampin greatly increased the plasma metabolite-to-parent drug ratios for noroxycodone and noroxymorphone (P < 0.001).
Pharmacologic effects of oral oxycodone were attenuated.
Induction of cytochrome P450 3A by rifampin reduced the area under the oxycodone concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral oxycodone.
The pharmacologic effects of oxycodone were modestly attenuated.
Effects of ketoconazole and carbamazepine on lapatinib pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.
To characterize the impact of potent CYP3A4 inhibition and induction on lapatinib pharmacokinetics.
Two studies were conducted in healthy subjects.
One study examined the effect of ketoconazole 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days on a single 100-mg dose of lapatinib in 22 healthy subjects.
The other study examined the effect of carbamazepine titrated up to 200 mg b.i.d. over 20 days on a single 250-mg dose of lapatinib in 24 healthy subjects.
Dose adjustments may be required when lapatinib is administered with orally administered drugs that potently alter the activity of this enzyme.
Ketoconazole altered lapatinib AUC, C(max) and half-life, with geometric mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] increases of 3.57-fold (3.07, 4.15), 2.14-fold (1.74, 2.64) and 1.66-fold (1.50, 1.84), respectively, but had no effect on absorption rate.
Carbamazepine altered lapatinib AUC, C(max) and absorption rate, with geometric mean (95% CI) decreases of 72% (68, 77), 59% (49, 66) and 28% (4, 46), respectively, but had no effect on half-life.
Systemic exposure to lapatinib was significantly altered by potent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4.
Effects of oral posaconazole on the pharmacokinetic properties of oral and intravenous midazolam: a phase I, randomized, open-label, crossover study in healthy volunteers.
Like itraconazole and ketoconazole, posaconazole, a broad-spectrum oral triazole antifungal, inhibits the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme 3A4.
Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Potential drug interactions can be expected in patients who are concurrently receiving inhibitors and substrates of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, posaconazole) and benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam).
Because of the potential for drug interactions, it is important to determine the effects of posaconazole on the pharmacokinetic properties of midazolam.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of oral administration of posaconazole versus ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetic properties of orally and intravenously administered midazolam.
This Phase I, randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted at Swiss Pharma Contract Ltd., Allschwil, Switzerland.
Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
Arm 1 received posaconazole 200 mg BID for 7 days, posaconazole 400 mg BID for 7 days, no drugs during a 28-day washout, and ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days.
Arm 2 received posaconazole and ketoconazole in the reverse order, with a 28-day washout between treatments.
An oral/IV midazolam sequence (oral midazolam 2 mg and IV midazolam 0.4 mg) was administered on days -2/-1, 6/7, 13/14 (arm 1), 36/17 (arm 2), 43/44, and 50/51 in both treatment arms.
Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after midazolam administration.
Pharmacokinetic parameters, including C(max), C(min) (before azole administration), terminal-phase t(1/2) (t(1/2z)), and AUC to final measurable sampling time (AUC(tf)), were calculated using noncompartmental methods, and drug interactions were evaluated using analysis of variance.
Adverse events were collected using physical examination, including vital sign measurements; clinical laboratory analysis; electrocardiography; and direct questioning at predefined time points throughout the study to assess tolerability.
A total of 12 subjects were enrolled (11 men, 1 woman; all white; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 28-53 years]; mean weight, 80.6 kg; and mean body mass index, 25.6 kg/m(2)).
All of the subjects completed the study.
Seven of 12 (58%) subjects reported > or =1 adverse event during the study (5 with posaconazole alone and 4 with posaconazole + midazolam).
The most common adverse events were diarrhea (3 subjects [25%] with posaconazole alone, 2 [17%] with ketoconazole alone, and 1 [8%] with posaconazole + midazolam) and flatulence (1 [8%] with posaconazole alone and 1 [8%] with midazolam alone).
The results from this study in a small, all-white population of healthy volunteers suggest that posaconazole was a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, but to a lesser extent than was ketoconazole.
Monitoring patients for adverse events, the need for dose adjustments, or both during coadministration with posaconazole may be warranted in patients being treated with benzodiazepines that are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4 (eg, midazolam).
Based on point estimates of logarithm-transformed data, posaconazole 200 and 400 mg BID were associated with significant increases in midazolam C(max) (up to 1.3- and 2.4-fold) and AUC(tf) values (up to 4.6- and 6.2-fold), respectively.
Ketoconazole 400 mg once daily was associated with significantly increased midazolam C(max) and AUC(tf) (up to 2.8- and 8.2-fold, respectively).
When midazolam was concurrently administered with either azole, t(1/2z) was prolonged.
Effects of concurrent administration of nevirapine on the disposition of quinine in healthy volunteers.
Nevirapine and quinine are likely to be administered concurrently in the treatment of patients with HIV and malaria.
Both drugs are metabolised to a significant extent by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and nevirapine is also an inducer of this enzyme.
This study therefore evaluated the effect of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of quinine.
Quinine (600 mg single dose) was administered either alone or with the 17th dose of nevirapine (200 mg every 12 h for 12 days) to 14 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion.
Blood samples collected at predetermined time intervals were analysed for quinine and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxquinine, using a validated HPLC method.
Administration of quinine plus nevirapine resulted in significant decreases (P < 0.01) in the total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(T)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and terminal elimination half-life (T((1/2)beta)) of quinine compared with values with quinine dosing alone (AUC: 53.29 +/- 4.01 vs 35.48 +/- 2.01 h mg/l; C(max): 2.83 +/- 0.16 vs 1.81 +/- 0.06 mg/l; T((1/2)beta): 11.35 +/- 0.72 vs 8.54 +/- 0.76 h), while the oral plasma clearance markedly increased (11.32 +/- 0.84 vs 16.97 +/- 0.98 l/h).
In the presence of nevirapine there was a pronounced increase in the ratio of AUC(metabolite)/AUC (unchanged drug) and highly significant increases in C(max) and AUC of the metabolite (P < 0.01).
Nevirapine significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of quinine.
An increase in the dose of quinine may be necessary when the drug is co-administered with nevirapine.
Mechanism of ritonavir changes in methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: II. Ritonavir effects on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein activities.
Ritonavir diminishes methadone plasma concentrations, an effect attributed to CYP3A induction, but the actual mechanisms are unknown.
We determined short-term (2-day) and steady-state (2-week) ritonavir effects on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4/5 (probed with intravenous (IV) and oral alfentanil (ALF) and with miosis) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (fexofenadine), and on methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers.
Acute ritonavir inhibits first-pass CYP3A > 96%.
Chronic ritonavir inhibits hepatic CYP3A (> 70%) and first-pass CYP3A (> 90%).
Steady-state compared with acute ritonavir caused mild apparent induction of P-gp and hepatic CYP3A, but net inhibition still predominated.
Ritonavir inhibited both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A and drug transport.
ALF miosis noninvasively determined CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir.
Acute ritonavir increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-infinity)/dose ratio (ritonavir/control) for oral ALF 25-fold.
Steady-state ritonavir increased the AUC(0-Infinity)/dose ratio for IV and oral ALF 4- and 10-fold, respectively; reduced hepatic extraction (from 0.26 to 0.07) and intestinal extraction (from 0.51 to 0); and increased bioavailability (from 37 to 95%).
Acute and steady-state ritonavir increased the fexofenadine AUC(0-infinity) 2.8- and 1.4-fold, respectively, suggesting P-gp inhibition.
Mechanism of ritonavir changes in methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: I. Evidence against CYP3A mediation of methadone clearance.
Ritonavir diminishes methadone plasma concentrations, an effect attributed to CYP3A induction, but the actual mechanisms are unknown.
We determined ritonavir effects on stereoselective methadone pharmacokinetics and clinical effects (pupillary miosis) in healthy human immunodeficiency virus-negative volunteers.
Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone after no ritonavir, short-term (3-day) ritonavir, and steady-state ritonavir.
Bioavailability was unchanged despite significant inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein.
Intestinal and hepatic CYP3A was inhibited > 70%.
Ritonavir shifted methadone plasma concentration-miosis curves leftward and upward.
Rapid ritonavir induction of methadone clearance results from increased renal clearance and induced hepatic metabolism.
Induction of methadone metabolism occurred despite profound CYP3A inhibition, suggesting no role for CYP3A in clinical methadone metabolism and clearance.
Acute and steady-state ritonavir, respectively, caused 1.5- and 2-fold induction of systemic and apparent oral R- and S-methadone clearances.
Ritonavir increased renal clearance 40-50%, and stereoselectively (S > R) increased hepatic methadone N-demethylation 50-80%, extraction twofold, and clearance twofold.
Ritonavir may alter methadone pharmacodynamics.
Methadone metabolism and clearance are induced by nelfinavir despite inhibition of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity.
Methadone plasma concentrations are decreased by nelfinavir.
Methadone clearance and the drug interactions have been attributed to CYP3A4, but actual mechanisms of methadone clearance and the nelfinavir interaction are unknown.
We assessed nelfinavir effects on methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4/5 activity, and intestinal P-glycoprotein transport activity.
CYP3A4/5 and transporters were assessed using alfentanil and fexofenadine, respectively.
Twelve healthy HIV-negative volunteers underwent a sequential crossover.
On three consecutive days they received oral alfentanil plus fexofenadine, intravenous alfentanil, and intravenous plus oral methadone.
This was repeated after nelfinavir.
Plasma and urine analytes were measured by mass spectrometry.
Opioid effects were measured by pupil diameter change (miosis).
Methadone bioavailability and P-glycoprotein activity were minimally affected.
Induction occurred despite 50% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4/5 activity and more than 75% inhibition of first-pass CYP3A4/5 activity, suggesting little or no role for CYP3A in clinical methadone disposition.
Nelfinavir decreased intravenous and oral methadone plasma concentrations 40-50%.
Systemic clearance, hepatic clearance, and hepatic extraction all increased 1.6- and 2-fold, respectively, for R- and S-methadone; apparent oral clearance increased 1.7- and 1.9-fold.
Nelfinavir stereoselectively increased (S>R) methadone metabolism and metabolite formation clearance, and methadone renal clearance.
Nelfinavir decreased alfentanil systemic and apparent oral clearances 50 and 76%, respectively.
Nelfinavir appeared to shift the methadone plasma concentration-effect (miosis) curve leftward and upward.
Nelfinavir induced methadone clearance by increasing renal clearance, and more so by stereoselectively increasing hepatic metabolism, extraction and clearance.
Nelfinavir may alter methadone pharmacodynamics, increasing clinical effects.
Methadone pharmacokinetics are independent of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity and gastrointestinal drug transport: insights from methadone interactions with ritonavir/indinavir.
Methadone clearance is highly variable, and drug interactions are problematic.
Both have been attributed to CYP3A, but actual mechanisms are unknown.
Drug interactions can provide such mechanistic information.
Ritonavir/indinavir, one of the earliest protease inhibitor combinations, may inhibit CYP3A.
We assessed ritonavir/indinavir effects on methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, and intestinal transporters (P-glycoprotein) activity.
CYP3A and transporters were assessed with alfentanil and fexofenadine, respectively.
Twelve healthy human immunodeficiency virus-negative volunteers underwent a sequential three-part crossover.
On three consecutive days, they received oral alfentanil/fexofenadine, intravenous alfentanil, and intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) methadone, repeated after acute (3 days) and steady-state (2 weeks) ritonavir/indinavir.
Plasma and urine analytes were measured by mass spectrometry.
Opioid effects were assessed by miosis.
Inhibition of both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A activity is responsible for ritonavir/indinavir drug interactions.
Methadone disposition was unchanged, despite profound inhibition of CYP3A activity, suggesting little or no role for CYP3A in clinical methadone metabolism and clearance.
Methadone bioavailability was unchanged, despite inhibition of gastrointestinal P-glycoprotein activity, suggesting that this transporter does not limit methadone intestinal absorption.
Alfentanil apparent oral clearance was inhibited more than 97% by both acute and steady-state ritonavir/indinavir, and systemic clearance was inhibited more than 90% due to diminished hepatic and intestinal extraction.
Ritonavir/indinavir increased fexofenadine area under the plasma concentration-time curve four- to five-fold, suggesting significant inhibition of gastrointestinal P-glycoprotein.
Ritonavir/indinavir slightly increased methadone N-demethylation, but it had no significant effects on methadone plasma concentrations or on systemic or apparent oral clearance, renal clearance, hepatic extraction or clearance, or bioavailability.
Ritonavir/indinavir had no significant effects on methadone plasma concentration-effect relationships.
Model-based approach to characterize efavirenz autoinduction and concurrent enzyme induction with carbamazepine.
Characterization of the time course and magnitude of enzyme induction due to multiple inducers is important for interpretation of clinical data from drug-drug interaction studies.
A population interaction model was developed to quantify efavirenz autoinduction and further induction with concurrent carbamazepine coadministration.
Efavirenz concentration data in the absence and presence of carbamazepine following single- and multiple-dose oral administrations in healthy subjects were used for model development.
The proposed model was able to describe the time-dependent efavirenz autoinduction and the further induction with carbamazepine when the agents were combined.
The estimated population averages of efavirenz oral clearance were 5.5, 9.4, 14.4, and 16.7 liters/h on days 1, 14, and 35 and at steady state for the interaction, respectively, for efavirenz monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by the coadministration of carbamazepine for 3 weeks.
The estimated times to 50% of the steady state for efavirenz autoinduction and for the induction resulting from the concurrent administration of efavirenz and carbamazepine were similar (around 10 to 12 days).
With this model-based analysis, efavirenz exposures can be projected prior to and at the steady state of induction, allowing a better understanding of the time course and magnitude of enzyme induction.
Effects of allicin on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity in healthy volunteers with different CYP2C19 genotypes.
To investigate the interaction between allicin and omeprazole and to observe the effects of allicin on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity in healthy Chinese male volunteers with different CYP2C19 genotypes.
Eighteen subjects (six CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1, four CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2, two CYP2C19*1/ CYP2C19*3, and six CYP2C19*2/ CYP2C19*2) were enrolled in a two-phase randomized crossover trial.
In each phase, all subjects received placebo or a 180 mg allicin capsule once daily for 14 consecutive days.
The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (20 mg orally on day 15) was determined for up to 12 h following administration by high-performance liquid chromatography.
However, no pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly changed by allicin in CYP2C19*2/CYP2C19*2.
The C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) of omeprazole sulfone were unchanged in all three genotypes.
Allicin did not significantly affect the activity of CYP3A4 in all subjects.
In carriers of the CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1 and CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2 or *3 genotype, allicin treatment increased the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of omeprazole by 49.7 +/- 7.2 (p < 0.001) and 54.2 +/- 9.2% (p < 0.001), and increased the area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of omeprazole by 48.1 +/- 9.0 (p = 0.001) and 73.6 +/- 26.7% (p < 0.001), respectively.
The ratio of AUC(0-infinity) of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to omeprazole (a marker for CYP2C19 activity) decreased significantly (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively).
Allicin reduced the metabolism of omeprazole by inhibiting CYP2C19 activity in individuals with the CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*1 and CYP2C19*1/CYP2C19*2 or *3 genotypes, but not in those with the CYP2C19*2/ CYP2C19*2 genotype.
Effect of desvenlafaxine on the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme system.
The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme is responsible for metabolizing approximately 25% of pharmaceutical agents.
Individuals with impaired CYP2D6 metabolism and those concomitantly receiving agents that inhibit CYP2D6 can have variations in concentrations of such medications and their metabolites.
Five studies assessing the interaction between desvenlafaxine and CYP2D6 are reviewed.
Study 1 compared desvenlafaxine area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) after administration of 100 mg of desvenlafaxine or 75 mg of venlafaxine extended release (ER).
Studies 2 to 5 assessed the effect of concomitant administration of desvenlafaxine 100 mg (studies 2, 4, and 5) or 400 mg (study 3), paroxetine (20 mg, study 4), and duloxetine (30 mg twice daily; study 5) on the CYP2D6 probe desipramine.
In study 1, there was no significant difference in mean desvenlafaxine AUC between the CYP2D6 EMs and PMs (-11%; P=0.641) who were administered desvenlafaxine.
However, PMs receiving venlafaxine ER had significantly higher venlafaxine and lower desvenlafaxine AUCs compared with EMs (+350% and -74%, respectively; P<0.001 for each).
Based on the findings presented here, desvenlafaxine is expected to have a low risk for variability in efficacy and safety/tolerability resulting from CYP2D6 polymorphisms or drug-drug interactions when coadministered with CYP2D6 substrates or inhibitors.
In studies 2, 4, and 5, the mean increases in desipramine AUC with concomitant administration of desvenlafaxine 100 mg ranged from 17% to 36%; the increase with concomitant administration of desvenlafaxine 400 mg (study 3) was 90%.
Paroxetine and duloxetine produced increases in mean desipramine AUC of 419% and 122%, respectively, which were significantly greater than the increases seen with desvenlafaxine 100 mg (P<0.001 for each comparison).
Itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, moderatelyincreases plasma concentrations of oral morphine.
Individual variation in opioid response is considerable, partly due to pharmacokinetic factors.
Transporter proteins are becoming increasingly interesting also in the pharmacokinetics of opioids.
The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein can affect gastrointestinal absorption and tissue distribution, particularly brain access of many opioids.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether itraconazole, which is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, would change the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamics of oral morphine.
Twelve healthy male volunteers ingested, in a randomized crossover study, once daily 200 mg itraconazole or placebo for 4 days.
On day 4, 1 h after the last pre-treatment dose, the subjects ingested 0.3 mg/kg morphine.
Blood samples for the determination of plasma morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and itraconazole concentrations were drawn up to 48 h after morphine ingestion.
Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated using a questionnaire, visual analogue scales, a reaction time test, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and the Critical Flicker Fusion Test.
A possible improvement of morphine penetration to the brain could not be observed.
Itraconazole increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-9)] of morphine by 29%(P=0.002), its AUC(0-48) by 22% (P=0.013) and its peak plasma concentration by 28% (P=0.035).
Itraconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic variables of M3G or M6G or the pharmacodynamic effects of morphine.
Itraconazole moderatelyincreases plasma concentrations of oral morphine, probably by enhancing its absorption by inhibiting intestinal wall P-glycoprotein.
Voriconazole increases while itraconazole decreases plasma meloxicam concentrations.
This study investigated the effect of voriconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and CYP3A4, and itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meloxicam.
Twelve healthy volunteers in a crossover study ingested 15 mg of meloxicam without pretreatment (control), after voriconazole pretreatment, and after itraconazole pretreatment.
The plasma concentrations of meloxicam, voriconazole, itraconazole, and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) generation were monitored.
Lowered plasma meloxicam concentrations during the itraconazole phase were associated with decreased pharmacodymic effects of meloxicam, as observed by weaker inhibition of TxB(2) synthesis compared to the control and voriconazole phases.
Compared to the control phase, voriconazole increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 72 h (AUC(0-72)) of meloxicam by 47% (P < 0.001) and prolonged its mean half-life (t(1/2)) by 51% (P < 0.01), without affecting its mean peak concentration (C(max)).
In contrast, itraconazole decreased the mean AUC(0-72) and C(max) of meloxicam by 37% (P < 0.001) and by 64% (P < 0.001), respectively, and prolonged its t(1/2) and time to C(max).
The plasma protein unbound fraction of meloxicam was unchanged by voriconazole and itraconazole.
Voriconazole increases plasma concentrations of meloxicam, whereas itraconazole, unexpectedly, decreases plasma meloxicam concentrations, possibly by impairing its absorption.
Efavirenz induces CYP2B6-mediated hydroxylation of bupropion in healthy subjects.
To characterize the effect of efavirenz on bupropion hydroxylation as a marker of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 activity in healthy subjects.
Thirteen subjects received a single oral dose of bupropion SR 150 mg before and after 2 weeks of efavirenz administration for comparison of bupropion and hydroxybupropion pharmacokinetics.
Efavirenz plasma concentrations were also assessed.
Subjects were genotyped for CYP2B6 (G516T, C1459T, and A785G), CYP3A4 (A-392G), CYP3A5 (A6986G), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (C3435T).
None of the CYP2B6 or CYP3A genotypes evaluated were associated with a difference in bupropion or efavirenz clearance.
The 2 individuals homozygous for multidrug resistance protein 1 3435-T/T had 2.5- and 1.8-fold greater bupropion and efavirenz clearance, respectively, relative to C/C and C/T individuals (P<0.05).
The area under the concentration vs. time curve ratio of hydroxybupropion:bupropion increased 2.3-fold after efavirenz administration (P=0.0001).
Bupropion area under the concentration vs. time curve and Cmax decreased by 55% and 34%, respectively (P<0.002).
Our results confirm that efavirenz induces CYP2B6 enzyme activity in vivo, as demonstrated by an increase in bupropion hydroxylation after 2 weeks of efavirenz administration.
Voriconazole drastically increases exposure to oral oxycodone.
We investigated the effect of voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone.
Twelve healthy subjects ingested either voriconazole or placebo for 4 days in a randomized, cross-over study.
On day 3, they ingested 10 mg oxycodone.
Timed plasma samples were collected for the measurement of oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, noroxymorphone and voriconazole up to 48 h, and pharmacodynamic effects were recorded.
Clinically, lower doses of oxycodone may be needed during voriconazole treatment to avoid opioid-related adverse effects especially after repeated dosing.
When voriconazole was taken at the same time as oxycodone, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of oxycodone increased 3.6-fold (range 2.7- to 5.6-fold), peak plasma concentration 1.7-fold and elimination half-life 2.0-fold (p < 0.001) when compared to placebo.
The AUC(0-infinity) ratio of noroxycodone to oxycodone was decreased by 92% (p < 0.001), and that of oxymorphone increased by 108% (p < 0.01).
Pharmacodynamic effects of oxycodone were modestly increased by voriconazole.
Voriconazole inhibits the CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation of oxycodone, drastically increasing exposure to oral oxycodone.
Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz when co-administered with rifampin in TB/HIV co-infected patients: pharmacogenetic effect of CYP2B6 variation.
The goal of this study was to determine the effect of CYP2B6 genetic variation on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of efavirenz (600 mg/d) in TB/HIV co-infected patients receiving concomitant rifampin, a potent CYP inducer.
In the 26 patients studied, CYP2B6 c.516GG, GT, and TT genotype frequencies were 0.27, 0.50, and 0.23, respectively.
Mean plasma efavirenz area under the curve was significantly higher in patients with CYP2B6 c.516TT than in those with GT (107 vs 27.6 microg x h/mL, P< .0001) or GG genotype (107 vs 23.0 microg x h/mL, P< .0001).
Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was significantly lower in patients with CYP2B6 c.516TT than in those with GT genotype (2.1 vs 8.4 mL/min/kg, P<0.0001) and GG genotype (2.1 vs 9.9 mL/min/kg, P< .0001).
No differences in efavirenz exposure or CL/F existed between patients with CYP2B6 c.516GT and GG genotypes.
Our results indicate that CYP2B6 c.516TT genotype can be used to identify efavirenz poor metabolizers in patients co-treated with rifampin.
Pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral midazolam in plasma and saliva in humans: usefulness of saliva as matrix for CYP3A phenotyping.
To compare midazolam kinetics between plasma and saliva and to find out whether saliva is suitable for CYP3A phenotyping.
This was a two way cross-over study in eight subjects treated with 2 mg midazolam IV or 7.5 mg orally under basal conditions and after CYP3A induction with rifampicin.
Under basal conditions and IV administration, midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam (plasma, saliva), 4-hydroxymidazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam-glucuronide (plasma) were detectable.
There was a significant correlation between the midazolam concentrations in plasma and saliva (basal conditions: r = 0.864, P < 0.0001; after rifampicin: r = 0.842, P < 0.0001).
After oral administration and basal conditions, midazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam were detectable in plasma and saliva.
The parameters separating best between basal conditions and post-rifampicin were: (1'-hydroxymidazolam + 1'-hydroxymidazolam-glucuronide)/midazolam at 20-30 min (plasma) and the AUC of midazolam (saliva) after IV, and the AUC of midazolam (plasma) and of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (plasma and saliva) after oral administration.
Saliva appears to be a suitable matrix for non-invasive CYP3A phenotyping using midazolam as a probe drug, but sensitive analytical methods are required.
After rifampicin, the AUC of midazolam [mean differences plasma 53.7 (95% CI 4.6, 102.9) and saliva 0.83 (95% CI 0.52, 1.14) ng ml(-1) h] and 1'-hydroxymidazolam [mean difference plasma 11.8 (95% CI 7.9 , 15.7) ng ml(-1) h] had decreased significantly.
After treatment with rifampicin, the AUC of midazolam [mean difference plasma 104.5 (95% CI 74.1, 134.9) ng ml(-1) h] and 1'-hydroxymidazolam [mean differences plasma 51.9 (95% CI 34.8, 69.1) and saliva 2.3 (95% CI 1.9, 2.7) ng ml(-1) h] had decreased significantly.
The role of cytochrome P2C19 in R-warfarin pharmacokinetics and its interaction with omeprazole.
Previous studies reported omeprazole to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and suggested the pharmacokinetic interaction of omeprazole with R-warfarin.
The aim of this study was to compare possible effects of omeprazole on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin between CYP2C19 genotypes.
Seventeen subjects, of whom 10 were homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs) and seven were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, were enrolled in this randomized crossover study, and they ingested 20 mg omeprazole or placebo once daily for 11 days.
On day 7, they administered a single dose of 10 mg racemic warfarin.
The plasma concentrations of warfarin enantiomers and prothrombin time expressed as international normalized ratio were monitored up to 120 hours.
During the placebo phase, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t1/2) of R-warfarin in PMs was significantly greater than those in hmEMs (AUC[0-infinity], 42,938/34,613 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM], P = 0.004; t1/2, 48.8/40.8 hours [PM/hmEM], P = 0.013).
There were no differences in S-warfarin pharmacokinetics between the CYP2C19 genotypes (AUC[0-infinity], 15,851/16,968 ng*h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 22.7/25.4 h [PM/hmEM]), or between the two treatment phases (AUC[0-infinity], 14,756/18,166 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 27.0/25.4 hours [PM/hmEM] in the omeprazole phase) as well as anticoagulant effects.
These results indicate that CYP2C19 activity was one of determinants on the R-warfarin disposition because the pharmacokinetics of warfarin enantiomers were different between the CYP2C19 genotypes and the omeprazole affected the R-warfarin pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 in only hmEMs.
Omeprazole treatment significantly increased the AUC(0-infinity) (41,387 ng h/mL, P = 0.004) and t1/2(46.4 hours, P = 0.017) of R-warfarin in hmEMs to levels comparable to those in the PMs.
However, the phamacodynamic effect of the interaction of warfarin with omeprazole would be of minor clinical significance.
Determinants of steady-state torasemide pharmacokinetics: impact of pharmacogenetic factors, gender and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
Torasemide is frequently used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.
However, the determinants of torasemide pharmacokinetics in patients during steady-state conditions are largely unknown.
We therefore explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (SLCO1B1), gender, and the effects of losartan and irbesartan comedication on the interindividual variability of steady-state pharmacokinetics of torasemide.
Twenty-four patients receiving stable medication with torasemide 10 mg once daily and with an indication for additional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment to control hypertension or to treat heart failure were selected.
Blood samples were taken before torasemide administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration.
After this first study period, patients received either irbesartan 150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) or losartan 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once daily.
After 3 days of ARB medication, eight blood samples were again collected at the timepoints indicated above.
The patients' long-term medications, which did not include known CYP2C9 inhibitors, were maintained at a constant dose during the study.
All patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*1/*1 [n=15]; *1/*2 [n = 4]; *1/*3 [n=5]) as well as for SLCO1B1 (c.521TT [n=13]; c.521TC [n=11]).
Factorial ANOVA revealed an independent impact of the CYP2C9 genotype (dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the 24-hour dosing interval at steady state [AUC(24,ss)/D]: *1/*1 375.5+/-151.4 microg x h/L/mg vs *1/*3 548.5+/-271.6 microg x h/L/mg, p=0.001), the SLCO1B1 genotype (AUC(24,ss)/D: TT 352.3+/-114 microg x h/L/mg vs TC 487.6+/-218.4 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.05) and gender (AUC(24,ss)/D: males 359.5+/-72.2 microg x h/L/mg vs females 547.3+/-284 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.01) on disposition of torasemide.
This study shows that the CYP2C9*3 and SLCO1B1 c.521TC genotype and female gender are significant and independent predictors of the pharmacokinetics of torasemide.
Coadministration of irbesartan caused a 13% increase in the AUC(24,ss)/D of torasemide (p=0.002), whereas losartan had no effect.
Coadministration of irbesartan yields moderate but significant increases in the torasemide plasma concentration and elimination half-life.
Effects of CYP3A4 inducers with and without CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers.
To assess the potential of known CYP3A4 inducers, with and without CYP3A4 inhibitors, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of maraviroc.
Two separate, open, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in healthy subjects.
Study 1 was a 28-day parallel-group study with three treatment groups of 12 subjects each.
On days 1-7, all subjects received maraviroc 100 mg b.i.d.; on days 8-21, subjects received maraviroc 100 mg b.i.d. plus either rifampicin 600 mg q.d., efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg q.d., or placebo q.d. as assigned; on days 22-28, the maraviroc dose was increased to 200 mg b.i.d. for patients receiving either rifampicin or EFV.
Study 2 was a 21-day, two-way crossover study with three cohorts (12 subjects per cohort).
On days 1-21, subjects received maraviroc 300 mg b.i.d. and boosted lopinavir (LPV/r, lopinavir 400 mg + ritonavir 100 mg) or placebo b.i.d. in cohort 1, maraviroc 100 mg b.i.d. and boosted saquinavir (SQV/r, saquinavir 1000 mg + ritonavir 100 mg) or placebo b.i.d. in cohort 2, and maraviroc 100 mg b.i.d. and 1000 mg saquinavir + LPV/r (400 mg/100 mg) or placebo b.i.d. in cohort 3.
On days 8-21, subjects in all three cohorts also received EFV 600 mg or placebo q.d. "
Maraviroc AUC(12) and C(max) approached preinduction values when the maraviroc dose was increased to 200 mg b.i.d. for both the rifampicin-treated and EFV-treated groups.
No pharmacokinetic data are reported for cohort 3 because all subjects were discontinued during period 1 due to poor toleration of the drug regimen.
There were no serious adverse events reported in either study, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.
Upward adjustment of the maraviroc dose during co-administration with rifampicin or EFV appears to compensate for this reduction.
Protease inhibitors (PIs) significantly increased maraviroc exposure; however, the addition of EFV to the maraviroc + PI regimens reduced the magnitude of PI-mediated increase in maraviroc exposure (by approximately 50%), but the net effect was still CYP3A4 inhibition.
Maraviroc (100 mg b.i.d.) exposure (AUC(12) and C(max)) was reduced in the presence of rifampicin and EFV by approximately 70% and 50%, respectively.
Co-administration of LPV/r with maraviroc (300 mg b.i.d.) resulted in geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of 395% and 197% for maraviroc AUC(12) and C(max), respectively, compared with placebo; addition of EFV resulted in GMRs of 253% and 125% for AUC(12) and C(max), respectively.
Co-administration of SQV/r with maraviroc (100 mg b.i.d.) resulted in GMRs of 977% and 478% for maraviroc AUC(12) and C(max), respectively, compared with placebo; addition of EFV resulted in GMRs of 500% and 226% for AUC(12) and C(max), respectively.
As expected with a CYP3A4 substrate, maraviroc exposure (C(max) and AUC(12)) was significantly reduced by the known CYP3A4 inducers, rifampicin and EFV, by approximately 70% and 50%, respectively.
Effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers.
To evaluate the influence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors on the clinical pharmacokinetics of maraviroc, a novel CCR5 antagonist.
Four open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in healthy subjects to assess the effect of separate and distinct combinations of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of maraviroc.
Study 1 was a two-way crossover study investigating the influence of saquinavir (SQV; 1200 mg t.i.d.) and ketoconazole (400 mg q.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (100 mg b.i.d.).
All subjects received maraviroc for 7 days in both study periods.
Cohort 1 subjects also received SQV or placebo and cohort 2 subjects also received ketoconazole or placebo.
Study 2 was a parallel-group study including four treatment groups investigating the effects of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r; 400 mg/100 mg b.i.d.), ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQV/r; 1000 mg/100 mg b.i.d.), and low-dose ritonavir (RTV; 100 mg b.i.d.) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (100 mg b.i.d.), and exploring whether maraviroc dose adjustment can compensate for interaction effects.
Treatment lasted 28 days and comprised three distinct phases: (i) maraviroc alone on days 1-7; (ii) maraviroc + interactant on days 8-21; and (iii) maraviroc (adjusted dose) + interactant on days 22-28.
Study 3 was a two-way crossover study investigating the effects of atazanavir (ATZ; 400 mg q.d.) and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATZ/r; 300 mg/100 mg b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (300 mg b.i.d.).
All subjects received maraviroc on days 1-14 of both study periods.
Subjects also received ATZ on days 1-7 and ATZ/r on days 8-14 of one treatment period, and placebo on days 1-14 of the other treatment period.
Study 4 was a two-way crossover study investigating the effects of ritonavir-boosted tipranavir (TPV/r; 500 mg/200 mg b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (150 mg b.i.d.).
Subjects received maraviroc plus TPV/r or placebo on days 1-8.
All of the drugs/drug combinations tested (except for TPV/r) increased maraviroc exposure, albeit to different degrees of magnitude.
Downward adjustment of the maraviroc dose in study 2 during co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors was able to compensate for the interactions.
TPV/r had no clinically relevant effect on maraviroc exposure at steady state.
There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events in any of the studies, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, including ketoconazole and protease inhibitors (except TPV/r), increase maraviroc exposure.
Downward adjustment of the maraviroc dose during co-administration with protease inhibitors can compensate for the interaction.
SQV/r caused the largest increase in maraviroc exposure (8.3-fold increase in AUC(tau)), whereas RTV caused the smallest increase in maraviroc exposure (2.6-fold increase in AUC(tau)).
TPV/rTPV/r does not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of maraviroc, and hence no dose adjustment would be warranted.
The different effects of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine enantiomers.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Recently, we have shown that the plasma concentration of R-fexofenadine is greater than that of the S-enantiomer.
Although itraconazole co-administration is known to increase the bioavailability of a racemic mixture of fexofenadine, little is known about the stereoselective inhibition of P-gp activity by itraconazole.
This study indicates that the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are due to P-gp-mediated transport and its stereoselectivity is altered by itraconazole, a an inhibitor of P-gp.
The aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effect of itraconazole, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine.
A two-way double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed with a 2-week washout period.
Twelve healthy volunteers received either itraconazole 200 mg or matched placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral dose of fexofenadine 60 mg simultaneously.
The plasma concentrations and the amount of urinary excretion (Ae) of fexofenadine enantiomers were measured up to 24 h after dosing.
After placebo administration, mean AUC(0,24 h) of S- and R-fexofenadine was 474 ng ml(-1) h (95% CI 311, 638) and 798 ng ml(-1) h (95% CI 497, 1101), respectively.
However, further study will be needed because the different affinities of the two enantiomers for P-gp have not been supported by in vitro studies.
Itraconazole affected the pharmacokinetic parameters of S-fexofenadine more, and increased AUC(0,24 h) of S-fexofenadine and R-fexofenadine by 4.0-fold (95% CI of differences 2.8, 5.3; P < 0.001) and by 3.1-fold (95% CI of differences 2.2, 4.0; P = 0.014), respectively, and Ae(0,24 h) of S-fexofenadine and R-fexofenadine by 3.6-fold (95% CI of differences 2.6, 4.5; P < 0.001) and by 2.9-fold (95% CI of differences 2.1, 3.8; P < 0.001), respectively.
Additionally, the R : S ratio for AUC(0,24 h) and Ae(0,24 h) were significantly reduced in the itraconazole phase, while t(max), t(1/2) and renal clearance were constant during the study.
This study indicates that the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are due to P-gp-mediated transport and its stereoselectivity is altered by itraconazole, a P-gp inhibitor.
Drug interaction between oral atorvastatin and verapamil in healthy subjects: effects of atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil.
It has been reported that verapamil and atorvastatin are inhibitors of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4.
Thus, it could be expected that atorvastatin would alter the absorption and metabolism of verapamil.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared after oral administration of verapamil (60 mg) in the presence or absence of oral atorvastatin (40 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers.
Thus, the relative bioavailability increased by the same magnitude with atorvastatin.
Pharmacokinetics of verapamil were significantly altered by the coadministration of atorvastatin compared with those of without atorvastatin.
For example, the total area under the plasma-concentration time curve to the last measured time, 24 h, in plasma (AUC(0-24) (h)) of verapamil increased significantly by 42.8%.
Although the AUC(0-24) (h) of norverapamil was not significantly different between two groups of humans, the AUC(0-24) (h, norverapamil)/ AUC(0-24) (h, verapamil) ratio was significantly reduced (27.5% decrease) with atorvastatin.
The above data suggest that atorvastatin could inhibit the absorption of verapamil via inhibition of P-gp and/or the metabolism of verapamil by CYP3A4 in humans.
Effect of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone.
The authors studied the effect of rifampin, a dual inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risperidone in humans.
Ten healthy male subjects were treated daily for 7 days with 600 mg rifampin or with placebo.
On day 6, a single dose of 1 mg risperidone was administered.
Plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations were measured.
Thus, rifampin reduced the exposure to risperidone, probably because of a decrease in its bioavailability through the induction of CYP3A and probably P-glycoprotein.
Rifampin significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 51% for risperidone, by 43% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and by 45% for the active moieties (risperidone + 9-hydroxyrisperidone).
Rifampin also decreased the peak plasma concentration of risperidone by 38%, 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 46%, and the active moieties by 41%.
The apparent oral clearance of risperidone approximately doubled after rifampin treatment.
Inhibition of metoprolol metabolism and potentiation of its effects by paroxetine in routinely treated patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
To investigate the influence of paroxetine on metoprolol concentrations and its effect in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who are routinely given paroxetine as a co-treatment of depression.
We recruited 17 depressed AMI patients who received metoprolol as a routine part of their therapy (mean dose 75 +/- 39 mg/day).
Patients were genotyped for CYP2D6 3, 4 and gene duplication.
Metoprolol and alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol were analyzed in plasma 0, 2, 6 and 12 h post-dose.
Heart rates (HR) at rest were registered after each sampling.
Paroxetine 20 mg daily was then administered, and all measurements were repeated on day 8.
All patients were genotypically extensive metabolizers (EMs) (nine with 1/1 and eight with 1/3 or 4).
Mean HRs were significantly lower after the study week at each time point.
Mean area under the HR versus time curve (AUEC) decreased (835 +/- 88 to 728 +/- 84 beats x h/min; P = 0.0007).
Metoprolol AUCs correlated with patients' AUECs at the baseline (Spearman r = -0.64, P < 0.01), but not on the eighth day of the study.
A reduction of metoprolol dose was required in two patients due to excessive bradycardia and severe orthostatic hypotension.
No other adverse effects of the drugs were identified.
We suggest, however, that the metoprolol dose is controlled upon initiation and withdrawal of paroxetine.
Following the administration of paroxetine, mean metoprolol areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased ( 1064 +/- 1213 to 4476 +/- 2821 nM x h/mg per kg, P = 0.0001), while metabolite AUCs decreased (1492 +/- 872 to 348 +/- 279 n M x h/mg per kg, P < 0.0001), with an increase of metabolic ratios (MR) (0.9 +/- 1.3 to 26 +/- 29; P < 0.0001).
A pronounced inhibition of metoprolol metabolism by paroxetine was observed in AMI patients, but without serious adverse effects.
Effect of voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac.
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, mainly by CYP2C9.
Our objective was to study the effect of voriconazole, a potent inhibitor of several CYP enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac.
This study had a two-way, open, crossover design and included 10 healthy CAUCasian male subjects.
In the control phase, the subjects ingested a single 50-mg oral dose of diclofenac.
In the voriconazole phase, the subjects ingested voriconazole 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily on the second day, and 50 mg diclofenac was given 1 h after the last dose of voriconazole.
Plasma diclofenac concentrations were determined for up to 24 h post-dose.
The inhibition of CYP2C9, and to some extent that of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes during the first-pass metabolism of diclofenac seems to be involved in the interaction.
The clinical importance of the interaction between voriconazole and diclofenac remains to be studied, but lower doses of diclofenac may be adequate for patients receiving voriconazole.
In the voriconazole phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of diclofenac was 178% (95% CI 143-212%; P < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration was 214% (95% CI 128-300%; P < 0.05) of the respective control value.
Voriconazole did not affect significantly the elimination half-life or time to maximum concentration of diclofenac.
The renal clearance of diclofenac was decreased by 47% (95% CI -76% to -16%; P < 0.01) by voriconazole.
In conclusion, voriconazole increased exposure to diclofenac, probably mainly by inhibition of its cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between voriconazole and efavirenz at steady state in healthy male subjects.
A randomized, placebo-controlled (with respect to voriconazole), 2-period, multiple-dose intragroup fixed-dose sequence study was conducted in 34 healthy male subjects to evaluate the interactions between voriconazole (triazole antifungal agent) and efavirenz (reverse transcriptase inhibitor).
In period 1, subjects received 200 mg twice-daily (bid) voriconazole (n = 17) or placebo (n = 17) for 3 days (400-mg bid loading doses on day 1).
Then efavirenz was coadministered with 200 mg bid voriconazole or placebo for the next 9 days (days 21-29).
Serial plasma voriconazole and efavirenz concentrations were measured on days 3, 19, and 29, and the safety data were collected throughout the study.
The increase in efavirenz exposure during coadministration is probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by voriconazole.
In period 2, following a 7-day washout, subjects received 400 mg once-daily (qd) efavirenz alone for 10 days (days 11-20).
The 400-mg qd efavirenz dose substantially reduced the steady-state mean voriconazole area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-12) by 80% (90% confidence interval [CI], 75%-84%) and peak concentration (Cmax) by 66%(90% CI, 57%-73%).
The decrease in voriconazole exposure during coadministration is probably mainly due to the induction of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 by efavirenz.
The 200 mg bid voriconazole increased the steady-state mean AUC0-24 and Cmax of efavirenz by 43% (90% CI, 36%-51%) and 37% (90% CI, 29%-46%), respectively.
Coadministration of 200 mg bid voriconazole with 400 mg (or higher) qd efavirenz is contraindicated due to the clinically significant effect of efavirenz on voriconazole pharmacokinetics.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between ketoconazole and praziquantel in healthy volunteers.
Praziquantel, a broad-spectrum anthelminthic, has been reported to undergo extensive first-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in vivo.
Ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, is known to markedly increase plasma concentrations of many co-administered drugs.
However, no data are available on the potential pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ketoconazole and praziquantel in humans.
To investigate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of ketoconazole with praziquantel in healthy adult Thai male volunteers.
In an open-label, randomized two-phase crossover study, separated by a 2-week period, 10 healthy adult Thai male volunteers ingested a single dose of 20 mg/kg praziquantel alone or with co-administration of 400-mg ketoconazole orally daily for 5 days.
Venous blood samples were collected at specific times for a 24-h period.
Plasma concentrations of praziquantel were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.
A non-compartmental model was applied for pharmacokinetic parameter analysis of praziquantel.
Our data suggest that when praziquantel is co-administered with ketoconazole, the dose of praziquantel could be reduced to half the standard dose of praziquantel to reduce the cost of therapy.
Concurrent administration of ketoconazole with praziquantel significantly increased the mean area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-alpha)) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of praziquantel by 93% (955.94 +/- 307.74 vs. 1843.10 +/- 336.39 ng h/mL; P < 0.01) and 102% (183.38 +/- 43.90 vs. 371.31 +/- 44.63 ng/mL; P < 0.01), respectively, whereas the mean total clearance (CL/F) of praziquantel was significantly decreased by 58% (2.65 +/- 0.64 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.35 mL/h/kg; P < 0.01).
Ketoconazole co-administration alters the pharmacokinetics of praziquantel in humans, possibly through inhibition of CYP3A, particularly CYP3A4, first-pass metabolism of praziquantel.
Effect of voriconazole and fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous fentanyl.
Fentanyl is a widely used opioid analgesic, which is extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A.
Recent reports suggest that concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors with fentanyl may lead to dangerous drug interactions.
The potential interactions of fentanyl with triazole antifungal agents voriconazole and fluconazole were studied in a randomized crossover study in three phases.
Twelve healthy volunteers were given 5 microg/kg of intravenous fentanyl without pretreatment (control), after oral voriconazole (400 mg twice on the first day and 200 mg twice on the second day), or after oral fluconazole (400 mg once on the first day and 200 mg once on the second day).
Plasma concentrations of fentanyl, norfentanyl, voriconazole, and fluconazole were determined up to 24 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using compartmental methods.
The initial plasma concentrations and volume of distribution of fentanyl did not differ significantly between phases.
Caution should be exercised, especially in patients who are given voriconazole or fluconazole during long-lasting fentanyl treatment, because insidiously elevated fentanyl concentration may lead to respiratory depression.
The mean plasma clearance of intravenous fentanyl was decreased by 23% (range -22 to 48%; p < 0.05) and 16% (-34 to 53%; p < 0.05) after voriconazole and fluconazole administration, respectively.
Voriconazole increased the area under the fentanyl plasma concentration-time curve by 1.4-fold (p < 0.05).
Both voriconazole and fluconazole delay the elimination of fentanyl significantly.
Trimethoprim and the CYP2C8*3 allele have opposite effects on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone.
We studied the effects of the CYP2C8 inhibitor trimethoprim and CYP2C8 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the antidiabetic pioglitazone.
In a randomized crossover study, 16 healthy volunteers with the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)1 (n = 8), (*)1/(*)3 (n = 5), or (*)3/(*)3 (n = 3) genotype ingested 160 mg of trimethoprim or placebo twice daily for 6 days.
On day 3, they ingested 15 mg of pioglitazone.
The effects of trimethoprim on pioglitazone were characterized in vitro.
During the placebo phase, the weight-adjusted AUC(0-infinity) of pioglitazone was 34% smaller in the CYP2C8(*)3/(*)3 group and 26% smaller in the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)3 group than in the CYP2C8(*)1/(*)1 group (p < 0.05).
In conclusion, drug interactions and pharmacogenetics affecting the CYP2C8 enzyme may change the safety of pioglitazone.
Trimethoprim raised the area under the plasma pioglitazone concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) by 42% (p < 0.001) and decreased the formation rates of pioglitazone metabolites M-IV and M-III (p < 0.001).
Trimethoprim inhibited M-IV formation in vitro (inhibition constant 38.2 muM), predicting the in vivo interaction.
A phase I study of docetaxel with ketoconazole modulation in patients with advanced cancers.
The aims were to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of docetaxel with CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole, and to correlate the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel with midazolam phenotyping of CYP3A activity.
Forty-one patients with refractory metastatic cancers were treated with an escalating dose of intravenous docetaxel once in every 3 week of 10 mg/m(2), concurrently with oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 3 days starting 2 days before the administration of docetaxel.
Midazolam phenotyping test with ketoconazole modulation was performed before the first cycle of docetaxel.
Docetaxel and midazolam pharmacokinetics were compared to our previous study of docetaxel treatment without ketoconazole modulation.
Neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity.
The maximum tolerated dose was 70 mg with mean AUC at 70 mg similar to 75 mg/m(2) of docetaxel without ketoconazole.
Docetaxel clearance correlated with renal function and maximum concentration of ketoconazole, but not midazolam clearance or other variables of hepatic function.
Fixed dosing was found to be feasible, without increased variability of clearance or neutrophil toxicity compared to BSA-based dosing.
With ketoconazole modulation, docetaxel clearance correlated with renal function but not CYP3A phenotype.
The plasma clearances of docetaxel and midazolam were reduced by 1.7- and 6-folds, respectively.
The variability of midazolam AUC was reduced from 157 to 67%, but variability of docetaxel clearance was not reduced by CYP3A inhibition.
Effect of terbinafine and voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the antidepressant venlafaxine.
This study investigated the effect of terbinafine and voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine in healthy volunteers.
Plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were measured after ingestion of 75 mg venlafaxine without pretreatment (control), after terbinafine pretreatment, or after voriconazole pretreatment.
The most likely mechanism for the interaction between terbinafine and venlafaxine is the inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of venlafaxine, whereas the minor effects of voriconazole are probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of venlafaxine.
During the terbinafine phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of venlafaxine was on average 490% (P<0.001) and that of ODV 57% (P<0.001) of the corresponding control value.
Terbinafine decreased the AUC(0-infinity) ratio of ODV over venlafaxine by 82% (P<0.001).
Voriconazole slightly increased the sum of AUC(0-infinity) of venlafaxine plus AUC(0-infinity) of ODV (active moiety) by 31% (P<0.001).
Voriconazole and fluconazole increase the exposure to oral diazepam.
We assessed the effect of voriconazole and fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diazepam.
Twelve healthy volunteers took 5 mg of oral diazepam in a randomised order on three study sessions: without pretreatment, after oral voriconazole 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily on the second day, or after oral fluconazole 400 mg on the first day and 200 mg on the second day.
Plasma concentrations of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were determined for up to 48 h. Pharmacodynamic variables were measured for 12 h.
This was associated with the prolongation of the mean elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 31 h to 61 h (p < 0.01) after voriconazole.
The pharmacodynamics of diazepam were changed only modestly.
Recurrent administration of diazepam increases the risk of clinically significant interactions during voriconazole or fluconazole treatment, because the elimination of diazepam is impaired significantly.
In the voriconazole phase, the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC 0-infinity) of diazepam was increased (geometric mean ratio) 2.2-fold (p < 0.05; 90% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 2.82).
In the fluconazole phase, the AUC 0-infinity of diazepam was increased 2.5-fold (p < 0.01; 90% CI 1.94 to 3.40), and the t(1/2) was prolonged from 31 h to 73 h (p < 0.001).
The peak plasma concentration of diazepam was practically unchanged by voriconazole and fluconazole.
Both voriconazole and fluconazole considerably increase the exposure to diazepam.
Effect of cinacalcet hydrochloride, a new calcimimetic agent, on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan: in vitro and clinical studies.
Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet) is a positive allosteric modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients.
In vitro study has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 with a K(i) value of 0.087 micromol/L, which is comparable to the well-known potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, quinidine (0.064 micromol/L).
A clinical study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 substrates in healthy volunteers.
Each subject received 50 mg of cinacalcet or a matched placebo orally once daily for 8 days with 30 mg of dextromethorphan coadministered on day 8.
Therefore, during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, it may be necessary to consider making dose adjustments for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6.
The mean AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of dextromethorphan increased 11- and 7-fold, respectively, in extensive metabolizers when coadministered with cinacalcet versus placebo.
Steady-state pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of voriconazole and ritonavir in healthy male subjects.
Since there is a likelihood of coadministration of voriconazole and ritonavir, two studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of drug interaction.
Study A was a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period, parallel-group trial (n = 34).
Study B had the same design without the placebo group (n = 17).
In period 1, subjects received 200 mg voriconazole or placebo twice daily (BID) for 3 days (400 mg BID on day 1).
In period 2, following a 7-day washout, subjects received ritonavir alone at 400 mg BID (study A) or 100 mg BID (study B) for 10 days (days 11 to 20), and then ritonavir was coadministered with 200 mg BID voriconazole or placebo for the next 10 days (days 21 to 30).
Serial plasma samples were collected on days 3, 20, and 30, and safety data were collected throughout the study.
However, the effect of low-dose (100 mg BID) ritonavir was less pronounced (AUC(0-12), -39%; C(max), -24%).
It is interesting that one subject in each study exhibited the opposite effect of ritonavir on voriconazole exposure (a 2.5- to 3-fold increase), probably due to lack of CYP2C19.
The safety profile of combination therapy was not notably different from that of voriconazole or ritonavir alone.
Due to the significant effect of ritonavir on voriconazole exposure, coadministration of voriconazole with 400 mg BID ritonavir is contraindicated; coadministration with 100 mg BID ritonavir should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use.
High-dose (400 mg BID) ritonavir substantially reduced the steady-state mean voriconazole exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h [AUC(0-12)], -82%; maximum concentration [C(max)], -66%).
The decrease in voriconazole exposure was probably due to the induction of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 by ritonavir.
Voriconazole had no apparent effect on the exposure of high-dose ritonavir but slightly decreased the exposure of low-dose ritonavir (AUC(0-12),-14%; C(max), -24%).
Drug interaction assessment following concomitant administration of posaconazole and phenytoin in healthy men.
Posaconazole is an extended-spectrum triazole antifungal agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections.
This randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multiple-dose study was conducted in healthy adult volunteers to assess the potential for a drug interaction between phenytoin and the posaconazole tablet formulation.
Subjects were randomly assigned for 10 days to one of the following treatments: posaconazole (200 mg once daily), phenytoin (200 mg once daily), or posaconazole (200 mg once daily) and phenytoin (200 mg once daily).
Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 10 for pharmacokinetic evaluation of posaconazole and phenytoin concentrations.
A total of 36 healthy men enrolled in the study.
On day 1, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve calculated from time 0-24 h post-dose (AUC(0-24)) were unchanged upon co-administration.
These decreases in exposure corresponded with a 90% increase in steady-state clearance of orally administered posaconazole.
At steady state (day 10), co-administration of posaconazole with phenytoin resulted in 44% (p = 0.012) and 52% (p = 0.007) decreases in posaconazole C(max) and AUC(0-24), respectively.
Phenytoin C(max) and AUC(0-24) were not significantly altered upon co-administration of the two agents, 24% increase in C(max) (p = 0.196) and 25% increase in AUC(0-24) (p = 0.212) values, although inter-subject variability was observed within this group.
Because co-administration of phenytoin and posaconazole significantly reduces posaconazole exposure and increases phenytoin levels in some subjects, concomitant use of these agents should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk.
Pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet hydrochloride when administered with ketoconazole.
The calcimimetic cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet) is used for treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease with secondary hyperparathyroidism, a population that commonly receives multiple concurrent medications.
Cinacalcet is eliminated primarily via oxidative metabolism mediated, in part, through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
Thus, the potential for an inhibitor of CYP3A4 to alter the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet is of clinical importance.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet during treatment with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole.
Twenty-four healthy subjects were enrolled in an open-label, crossover, phase I study to receive a single oral dose of cinacalcet (90 mg) alone and with 7 days of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily).
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected for up to 72 hours postdose.
Cinacalcet plasma concentration-time data were analysed by noncompartmental methods.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were analysed using a crossover ANOVA model that included subjects who completed both treatment arms.
Twenty subjects completed both treatment arms.
The time to reach the maximum plasma concentration was not significantly affected, and the terminal elimination half-lives were similar between treatments.
This suggests that clinicians should monitor parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations when a patient receiving cinacalcet initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of cinacalcet increased 2.3-fold (90% CI 1.92, 2.67) [range 1.15- to 7.12-fold] and the mean maximum plasma concentration increased 2.2-fold (90% CI 1.67, 2.78) [range 0.904- to 10.8-fold] when administered with ketoconazole, relative to when administered alone.
Co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor moderatelyincreased cinacalcet exposure in study subjects.
Does tenofovir influence efavirenz pharmacokinetics?"
A recent report described a possible interaction between tenofovir (TFV) and efavirenz (EFV).
Patients developed neuropsychiatric manifestations upon introduction of TFV on a stable EFV-containing regimen.
We evaluated the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction between TFV and EFV by assessing cross-sectional and longitudinal data in 169 individuals receiving EFV.
However, under conditions of limited EFV metabolism, that is, the group of 23 individuals carrying two copies of CYP2B6 loss/diminished-function alleles, plasma AUC values were highest among individuals receiving TFV (n=5, 353,031 ng*h/ml), compared with those not receiving TFV (n=18, 180,689 ng*h/ml).
Statistical analysis identified both a global, sixfold effect of CYP2B6 loss/diminished function (P < 0.0001) and a significant interaction between the number of loss/diminished-function alleles and the co-medication with TFV (P = 0.009).
Although there is no clear evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction between TFV and EFV, we cannot rule out an interaction between these drugs restricted to individuals who are slow EFV metabolizers.
EFV plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels were comparable among individuals receiving (n=18) or not receiving TFV (n=151); 57,962 versus 52,293 ng*h/ml.
Pharmacokinetic effect of ketoconazole on solifenacin in healthy volunteers.
Solifenacin succinate (YM905) is a new, once-daily, orally administered muscarinic receptor antagonist designed to treat overactive bladder.
The metabolism of solifenacin involves hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin may be affected by drugs that inhibit CYP3A4.
This study aimed to examine the effects of co-administration of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin in healthy volunteers.
In a single-site, open-label, monosequence, crossover study, 17 healthy men and women aged 18 to 65 years received a single 10 mg oral dose of solifenacin, which is is the highest available dose.
After a 14-day wash-out period, they began 20 days of oral ketoconazole at a dose of 200 mg once daily.
A single 10 mg dose of solifenacin was administered again on day 7 of ketoconazole treatment.
Pharmacokinetics was assessed using the standard measurements of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax, area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life (t1/2).
No substantial increase in the overall rate of adverse events, and no significant effects on vital signs, electrocardiography, clinical laboratory values, or physical examinations were noted.
Co-administration of ketoconazole resulted in a 1.43 times increase in the C(max) of solifenacin and an approximately 2 times increase in AUC.
The mean t1/2 of solifenacin was extended from 49.3 to 77.5 hr whereas time to Cmax did not change.
Administration of 200 mg ketoconazole once daily in healthy male volunteers resulted in a 2 times increase in exposure of a single 10 mg dose of solifenacin.
Since ketoconazole is one of the strongest inhibitors of CYP3A4, it is expected that co-administration of other CYP3A4 inhibitors will not result in a stronger increase in solifenacin exposure.
The CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil does not increase the plasma concentrations of zopiclone.
Zopiclone is a short acting hypnotic, which is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C8 in vitro.
We studied the possible effect of gemfibrozil, an inhibitor of CYP2C8, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zopiclone.
In a randomised 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, each ingested a 7.5 mg dose of zopiclone.
Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of zopiclone and its two primary metabolites, plasma gemfibrozil, and psychomotor performance were measured.
The effects of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors on the depletion of zopiclone (500 nM) were studied in vitro in human liver microsomes.
In vitro, ketoconazole (1 microM) and itraconazole (8 microM) decreased the elimination rate of zopiclone enantiomers by about 65-95%, while montelukast (16 microM), gemfibrozil (200 microM) and sulfaphenazole (10 microM) had no appreciable effect.
Accordingly, CYP2C8 does not significantly metabolise zopiclone in vivo.
The pharmacokinetic variables of the parent zopiclone were not significantly affected by gemfibrozil.
However, gemfibrozil raised the mean peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of N-oxide-zopiclone (1.6-fold; P<0.001) and that of N-desmethyl-zopiclone (1.2-fold; P<0.001).
The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0)-infinity) values of N-oxide-zopiclone and N-desmethyl-zopiclone were raised 2-fold (P<0.001) and 1.2-fold (P<0.01), respectively.
The renal clearance of N-oxide-zopiclone was reduced by 48% by gemfibrozil (P<0.001).
The pharmacodynamic effects of zopiclone, measured using psychometric tests, were not affected by gemfibrozil.
Gemfibrozil does not increase the plasma concentrations of the parent zopiclone.
However, as gemfibrozil raises the concentrations of two potentially active metabolites of zopiclone, slightly enhanced effects of zopiclone by gemfibrozil can not be excluded.
Cytochrome P450 2B6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxylation: effect of induction by rifampin and ethnicity.
The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 before and after in vivo induction by rifampin (INN, rifampicin) in white subjects and Chinese subjects by use of the probe drug bupropion (INN, amfebutamone).
Healthy male white subjects (n = 9) and Chinese subjects (n = 9) (age range, 19-34 years) of known CYP2B6 genotype received orally administered bupropion (Zyban SR, 150 mg) alone and during daily treatment with rifampin (600 mg).
Blood samples were taken for up to 72 hours after each bupropion dose, and plasma concentrations of bupropion and its active metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion, were measured by HPLC.
The subjects' CYP2B6 genotype was determined by use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption /ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay.
There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or hydroxybupropion between white subjects and Chinese subjects before and after treatment with rifampin, once corrected for body weight.
Rifampin significantly inducers CYP2B6 activity in vivo, and the clinical consequences of potential interactions between rifampin and CYP2B6 substrates deserve further investigation.
Rifampin appears to induce the elimination of hydroxybupropion.
Differences in bupropion pharmacokinetics that were observed between white subjects and Chinese subjects can be attributed to differences in body weight, suggesting that, for a given subject weight, CYP2B6 activity is similar in white subjects and Chinese subjects.
Rifampin treatment increased the apparent clearance of bupropion in Chinese subjects and white subjects combined (n = 16) from 2.6 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.0 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)) after bupropion alone to 7.9 L x h(-1) x kg(-1) (95% CI, 6.8-10.1 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)) during rifampin treatment.
Rifampin treatment decreased the half-life of bupropion from 15.9 hours (95% CI, 13.5-20.4 hours) to 8.2 hours (95% CI, 6.7-12.4 hours).
Rifampin treatment increased the hydroxybupropion maximum concentration from 395 ng/mL (95% CI, 341-497 ng/mL) to 548 ng/mL (95% CI, 490-638 ng/mL), decreased the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity of hydroxybupropion from 14.7 microg x h/mL (95% CI, 12.7-18.4 microg x h/mL) to 8.4 microg x h/mL (95% CI, 7.4-10.2 microg x h/mL), and reduced the elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion from 21.9 hours (95% CI, 20.3-24.0 hours) to 10.7 hours (95% CI, 8.6-14.5 hours).
Influence of high-dose ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel are characterized by large inter-individual variability in systemic drug exposure (AUC) and drug clearance.
The PK variability is thought to be largely related to differences in the catalytic function of CYP3A, involved in docetaxel metabolism and elimination.
As variability in efficacy and toxicity is associated with variability in docetaxel AUC and clearance, reducing inter-individual PK variability may help improve the risk-benefit ratio of docetaxel therapy.
We investigated if high-dose ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, could result in a uniform reduction of docetaxel clearance and reduce the inter-individual variability in docetaxel AUC and clearance.
Seven patients were treated in a randomized-cross over design with intravenous docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) followed 3 weeks later by docetaxel (15 mg/m(2)) given in combination with orally administered ketoconazole (400 mg 3 times daily, up to 47 hours after docetaxel infusion) or vice versa.
Docetaxel plasma concentration-time data were described by a three-compartment PK model.
Ketoconazole plasma concentration-time data were described by a one-compartment PK model.
In the presence of ketoconazole, inter-individual variability in clearance and AUC, expressed as coefficient of variation, was increased from 41.6 to 49.5% and from 28.0 to 35.1%, respectively, and not, as we had hypothesized, reduced.
Inhibition of CYP3A by concomitant high-dose ketoconazole administration does not result in a uniform reduction of docetaxel clearance and does not reduce the inter-individual variability in docetaxel AUC or clearance.
This approach is unsuitable as method to achieve a uniform docetaxel PK profile.
Docetaxel clearance was reduced by 50% (P = .018) from 32.8 +/- 13.7 L/hr to 16.5 +/- 8.15 L/hr upon ketoconazole coadministration, albeit with large inter-individual variability (fractional change in clearance, range 0.31 - 0.66).
Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl.
In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects.
Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days).
Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose.
Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms.
The t (max) was similar between the regimens.
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet.
This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6.
These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.
Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet.
The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs).
Combined effects of itraconazole and CYP2D6*10 genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of haloperidol in healthy subjects.
This study was to evaluate the combined effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole and the CYP2D6*10 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of haloperidol, a substrate of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, in healthy subjects.
Nineteen healthy volunteers whose CYP2D6 genotypes were predetermined were enrolled (9 for CYP2D6*1/*1 and 10 for CYP2D6*10/*10).
Four subjects (1 for CYP2D6*1/*1 and 3 for CYP2D6*10/*10) did not complete the study because of adverse events.
The pharmacokinetics of haloperidol and its pharmacodynamic effects measured for QTc prolongation and neurologic side effects were evaluated after a single dose of 5 mg haloperidol following a pretreatment of placebo or itraconazole at 200 mg/d for 10 days in a randomized crossover manner.
The subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 genotype showed 81% higher AUC compared to that of subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype (27.6 +/- 22.2 vs 50.2 +/- 47.1 ng h/mL).
In the subjects with both CYP2D6*10 genotype and itraconazole pretreatment, however, the oral clearance was significantly decreased to 42% of subjects with wild genotype in the placebo pretreatment (4.7 +/- 3.6 vs 2.0 +/- 1.9 L/h/kg; P < 0.05).
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) of subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 in the presence of itraconazole pretreatment was significantly higher than that of subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype in the period of placebo pretreatment.
Except for this, all other pharmacodynamic estimations did not reach to statistical significance although each CYP2D6*10 genotype and itraconazole pretreatment caused higher value of UKU side effect and BARS scores.
Itraconazole pretreatment increased the mean area under the time-concentration curves (AUCs) of haloperidol by 55% compared to placebo pretreatment (21.7 +/- 11.3 vs 33.5 +/- 29.3 ng h/mL).
In the presence of itraconazole, subjects with CYP2D6*10/*10 showed 3-fold higher AUC of haloperidol compared to that of placebo pretreated subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1 genotype (21.7 +/- 11.3 vs 66.7 +/- 62.1 ng h/mL; P < 0.05).
The CYP2D6*10 genotype and itraconazole pretreatment decreased the oral clearance of haloperidol by 24% and 25%, respectively, but without a statistical significance.
The moderate effect of CYP2D6*10 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of haloperidol seems to be augmented by the presence of itraconazole pretreatment.
Different effects of fluvoxamine on rabeprazole pharmacokinetics in relation to CYP2C19 genotype status.
Rabeprazole is known to be a substrate of CYP2C19.
Our objective was to evaluate the possible effect of an inhibitor of CYP2C19, fluvoxamine, and compare the inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on the metabolism of rabeprazole between CYP2C19 genotypes.
A two-way randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed.
Twenty-one volunteers, of whom seven were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), eight were heterozygous EMs and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, received two 6-day courses of either fluvoxamine 50 mg or placebo daily in a randomized fashion with a single oral dose of rabeprazole 20 mg on day 6 in all cases.
Plasma concentrations of rabeprazole and its metabolite rabeprazole thioether were monitored up to 24 h after dosing.
During placebo administration, the mean AUCs(0,infinity) of rabeprazole in homozygous EMs, heterozygous EMs and PMs were 882 (95% CI, 602, 1162) ng ml-1h , 1214 (975, 1453) ng ml-1 h and 2762 (2482, 3042) ng ml-1 h (P<0.001), respectively.
There was a significant difference in fluvoxamine-mediated percentage increase in AUC(0,infinity) of rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether between CYP2C19 genotypes.
It is predominantly involved in rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether metabolism in EMs.
Therefore, CYP2C19 is the key determinant of rabeprazole disposition in EMs.
Fluvoxamine treatment increased AUC(0,infinity) of rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether by 2.8-fold (P<0.001) and 5.1-fold (P<0.01) in homozygous EMs, and by 1.7-fold (P<0.01) and 2.6-fold (P<0.01) in heterozygous EMs, and significantly prolonged the elimination half-life of rabeprazole and rabeprazole thioether in homozygous EMs and in heterozygous EMs, whereas no difference in any pharmacokinetic parameters was found in PMs.
The present study indicates that there are significant drug interactions between rabeprazole and fluvoxamine in EMs of CYP2C19.
Pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin are significantly altered by rifampicin-mediated CYP3A4 induction.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rifampicin co-administration on the pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin and its active metabolite, N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin and, in addition, to compare the changes in pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin with the urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol : cortisol ratio.
Ruboxistaurin is a specific protein-kinase-C beta inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of diabetic microvascular complications.
This was a two-period, one-sequence study.
Sixteen healthy male subjects completed both study periods.
In period one, a single 64 mg oral dose of ruboxistaurin was administered.
In period two, 600 mg rifampicin was administered daily for 9 days, during which another single 64 mg ruboxistaurin dose was administered on day 7.
Blood samples were collected and assayed for ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl ruboxistaurin.
CYP3A4 induction was assessed by ratios of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol : cortisol (6beta-OHC : C) obtained via 24 h and morning-spot sampling techniques.
For the metabolite, the mean C(max) decreased by 68% (P < or = 0.001), and AUC(0,infinity) decreased by 77% (P < or = 0.001).
The t(max) values did not appear affected.
The 6beta-OHC : C ratios from both 24 h and morning spot methods increased significantly, consistent with CYP3A4 induction.
In this study, 6beta OHC : C ratios substantially underestimated the impact of rifampicin on ruboxistaurin.
Results Following repeated doses of rifampicin, both the mean C(max) and AUC(0,infinity) of ruboxistaurin were significantly reduced by approximately 95% (P < or = 0.001).
The effect of rifampicin co-administration on the exposure of ruboxistaurin is consistent with ruboxistaurin being a substrate of CYP3A4.
Therefore, co-administration with known CYP3A4 inducing agents (rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, etc.) may decrease the concentrations of ruboxistaurin and N-desmethyl-ruboxistaurin.
Effect of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of cabergoline in healthy controls and in patients with Parkinson's disease.
Cabergoline is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).
Clarithromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and is often co-administered with cabergoline in usual clinical practice.
We studied the effect of clarithromycin co-administration on the blood concentration of cabergoline in healthy male volunteers and in PD patients.
Study 1: Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled and were randomized to take a single oral dose of cabergoline (1 mg/day) for 6 days or a single oral dose of cabergoline plus clarithromycin (400 mg/day) for 6 days.
Study 2: Seven PD patients receiving stable cabergoline doses were enrolled.
They were evaluated for the plasma cabergoline concentration before and after the addition of clarithromycin 400 mg/day for 6 days, and again 1 month after discontinuation of clarithromycin.
The dose and duration of clarithromycin were decided according to usual clinical practice.
In healthy male volunteers, mean Cmax and AUC(0-10 h) of cabergoline increased to a similar degree during co-administration of clarithromycin.
Mean plasma cabergoline concentration over 10 h post-dosing increased 2.6-fold with clarithromycin co-administration.
In PD patients, plasma cabergoline concentration increased 1.7-fold during clarithromycin co-administration.
Co-administration with clarithromycin may increase the blood concentration of cabergoline in healthy volunteers and in PD patients.
Effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone.
The effect of enzyme induction on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug that is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8, is not known.
rifampicin is a potent inducer of several CYP enzymes and our objective was to study its effects on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone in humans.
In a randomized, two-phase crossover study, ten healthy subjects ingested either 600 mg rifampicin or placebo once daily for 6 days.
On the last day, they received a single oral dose of 30 mg pioglitazone.
The plasma concentrations and cumulative excretion of pioglitazone and its active metabolites M-IV and M-III into urine were measured up to 48 h. "
No significant effect on peak concentration (C(max)) or time to peak (t(max)) was observed.
rifampicin increased the apparent formation rate of M-IV and shortened its t(max) (P < 0.01).
It also decreased the AUC(0-infinity) of M-IV (by 34%; P = 0.0055) and M-III (by 39%; P = 0.0026), shortened their t1/2 (M-IV by 50%; P = 0.0008, and M-III by 55%; P = 0.0016) and increased the AUC(0-infinity) ratios of M-IV and M-III to pioglitazone by 44% (P = 0.0011) and 32% (P = 0.0027), respectively.
rifampicin increased the M-IV/pioglitazone and M-III/pioglitazone ratios in urine by 98% (P = 0.0015) and 95% (P = 0.0024).
A previously unrecognized metabolite M-XI, tentatively identified as a dihydroxy metabolite, was detected in urine during both phases, and rifampicin increased the ratio of M-XI to pioglitazone by 240% (P = 0.0020).
rifampicin decreased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of pioglitazone by 54% (range 20-66%; P = 0.0007; 95% confidence interval -78 to -30%) and shortened its dominant elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 4.9 to 2.3 h (P = 0.0002).
rifampicin caused a substantial decrease in the plasma concentration of pioglitazone, probably by induction of CYP2C8.
Concomitant use of rifampicin with pioglitazone may decrease the efficacy of the latter drug.
Effects of cytochrome P450 3A modulators ketoconazole and carbamazepine on quetiapine pharmacokinetics.
To explore the potential for drug interactions on quetiapine pharmacokinetics using in vitro and in vivo assessments.
The CYP enzymes responsible for quetiapine metabolite formation were assessed using recombinant expressed CYPs and CYP-selective inhibitors.
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transport was tested in MDCK cells expressing the human MDR1 gene.
The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition were evaluated clinically in 12 healthy volunteers that received 25 mg quetiapine before and after 4 days of treatment with ketoconazole 200 mg daily.
To assess CYP3A4 induction in vivo, 18 patients with psychiatric disorders were titrated to steady-state quetiapine levels (300 mg twice daily), then titrated to 600 mg daily carbamazepine for 2 weeks.
CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for formation of quetiapine sulfoxide and N- and O-desalkylquetiapine and not a Pgp substrate.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of quetiapine.
In the clinical studies, ketoconazole increased mean quetiapine plasma C(max) by 3.35-fold, from 45 to 150 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 2.51, 4.47) and decreased its clearance (CL/F) by 84%, from 138 to 22 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 0.13, 0.20).
Carbamazepine decreased quetiapine plasma C(max) by 80%, from 1042 to 205 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 0.14, 0.28) and increased its clearance 7.5-fold, from 65 to 483 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 6.04, 9.28).
Quetiapine pharmacokinetics were affected by concomitant administration of ketoconazole and carbamazepine, and therefore other drugs and ingested natural products that strongly modulate the activity or expression of CYP3A4 would be predicted to change exposure to quetiapine.
Effect of low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the activity of cytochrome P450 2D6 in healthy volunteers.
In the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, the protease inhibitor ritonavir is used in a low dose (100 mg twice daily) to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and thereby increase plasma concentrations of coadministered protease inhibitors.
When applied in a therapeutic dose (600 mg twice daily), ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6.
The effect of low-dose ritonavir on CYP2D6 is unknown and was investigated in this study.
This was a 1-arm, 2-period, fixed-order study in 13 healthy male volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.
The first period examined baseline CYP2D6 activity by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of desipramine and by metabolic phenotyping with dextromethorphan.
During the second period, participants took ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, for 2 weeks, followed by repeat assessment of desipramine pharmacokinetics and the dextromethorphan metabolic phenotype in the presence of ritonavir.
This effect was not apparent with the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratio as an indicator for CYP2D6 activity.
It is expected that the effect of low-dose ritonavir on CYP2D6 will not require standard dose reductions for CYP2D6 substrates.
Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) significantly increased the exposure to single-dose desipramine, as reflected in a geometric mean ratio (with ritonavir/without ritonavir) of 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.40) for the desipramine area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity (P < .001).
Coadministration of low-dose ritonavir did not significantly affect the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan urinary metabolic ratio and did not convert any extensive metabolizer to a poor metabolizer.
Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) exerts a modest inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2D6 in extensive metabolizers, as assessed with desipramine as the index substrate.
Effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone.
Our objective was to study the effects of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and the active compounds, which are all the substrates of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.
In a randomized, two-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers were pretreated for 2 days with either 600 mg oral gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily.
On day 3, they received a single dose of 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo, and 1 h later they received a single oral dose of 30 mg pioglitazone.
Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and both active metabolites M-III and M-IV were measured for up to 120 h. "
No statistically significant changes were seen in the total AUC of M-III or M-IV after gemfibrozil pretreatment.
Gemfibrozil reduced the M-III/pioglitazone and M-IV/pioglitazone AUC(0-infinity) ratio by 71% (P<0.001) and 65%(P<0.001), strikingly prolonging their t((1/2)).
Gemfibrozil raised the mean total area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of parent pioglitazone 3.4-fold (P<0.001).
Gemfibrozil greatly increased the plasma concentration of parent pioglitazone and also inhibited the further metabolism of M-III and M-IV.
Careful blood glucose monitoring and dosage adjustments are suggested during coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil.
Fluvoxamine affects sildenafil kinetics and dynamics.
Sildenafil used as oral drug treatment for erectile dysfunction is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4.
The antidepressant fluvoxamine is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we evaluated the effects of fluvoxamine dosed to steady state on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil.
Twelve healthy men received oral fluvoxamine or placebo for 10 days (50 mg every day on days 1-3; 100 mg every day on days 4-10).
On day 11, all participants received a single, oral, open-label dose of 50 mg sildenafil, and blood samples were collected for analysis of sildenafil plasma concentrations by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Concurrently, the effect of sildenafil on venodilation induced by a constant dose of sodium nitroprusside was assessed using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique.
Sildenafil was well tolerated in the presence of fluvoxamine.
Concurrently, sodium nitroprusside-induced venodilation was significantly augmented by 59% during fluvoxamine compared to placebo (P = 0.012).
Whereas the pharmacokinetic changes do not suggest a large clinically relevant interaction, it may be prudent to consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients concurrently treated with fluvoxamine.
During fluvoxamine, sildenafil exposure (area under the curve) significantly increased by 40% (P < 0.001), and its half-life increased by 19% (P = 0.034).
In conclusion, sildenafil kinetics are mildly affected by fluvoxamine which translates into an increase in vascular sildenafil effects.
Interaction magnitude, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticlopidine in relation to CYP2C19 genotypic status.
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the extent of the interaction and on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticlopidine.
Homozygous (hmEMs) and heterozygous extensive metabolizers (htEMs), and poor metabolizers (PMs, n = 6 each) took an oral dose (20 mg) of omeprazole.
After a 1-week washout period, each subject received ticlopidine (200 mg) for 8 days, and ticlopidine pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 7.
On day 8, omeprazole was given again and its kinetic disposition was compared with that in the first dose.
ADP-induced platelet aggregation was measured as a pharmacodynamic index.
No significant intergenotypic differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticlopidine were observed, although the accumulation ratio tended to be greater in hmEMs than in PMs (2.4 +/- 0.2 versus 1.7 +/- 0.2).
A significantly positive correlation (P = 0.031) was observed between the individual percent inhibition of platelet aggregation and AUC0-24 of ticlopidine regardless of the CYP2C19 polymorphism.
Ticlopidine is a potent inhibitor for CYP2C19 and may be associated with the phenocopy when CYPC19 substrates are co-administered to EMs.
Whether and to what extent CYP2C19 would be involved in the metabolism of ticlopidine remain unanswered from the present in-vivo study.
In contrast to the PMs, whose mean kinetic parameters were not altered by the repeated dosings of ticlopidine, an eight- to 10-fold increase in the mean AUC ratio of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole was observed in both the EM groups.
Fluvoxamine impairs single-dose caffeine clearance without altering caffeine pharmacodynamics.
Coadministration of fluvoxamine impairs the clearance of caffeine and prolongs its elimination half-life, which is attributable to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine.
The clinical importance of this interaction is not established.
To evaluate the effects of fluvoxamine on the kinetics and dynamics of single doses of caffeine.
Seven healthy subjects received single 250 mg doses of caffeine (or matching placebo) together with fluvoxamine (four doses of 100 mg over 2 days) or with matching placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study.
For 24 h after caffeine or placebo administration, plasma caffeine and fluvoxamine concentrations were determined.
Psychomotor performance, sedation, and electroencephalographic (EEG) \"beta\" frequency activity were also assessed.
Caffeine produced CNS-stimulating effects compared with placebo.
However, psychomotor performance, alertness, or EEG effects attributable to caffeine were not augmented by coadministration of fluvoxamine.
However, this study does not rule out possible adverse effects due to extensive accumulation of caffeine with daily ingestion in fluvoxamine-treated individuals.
Fluvoxamine significantly reduced apparent oral clearance of caffeine (105 vs. 9.1 mL min(-1), P < 0.01; mean difference: 95.7 mL min(-1), 95% CI: 54.9-135.6), and prolonged its elimination half-life (4.9 vs. 56 h, P < 0.01; mean difference: 51 h, 95% CI: 26-76).
Fluvoxamine greatly impaired caffeine clearance, but without detectable changes in caffeine pharmacodynamics.
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions of gefitinib with rifampicin, itraconazole and metoprolol.
Gefitinib (IRESSA, ZD1839), an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved in several countries for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
Preclinical studies were conducted to determine the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of gefitinib and to evaluate the potential of gefitinib to cause drug interactions through inhibition of CYP isoenzymes.
Based on these findings, three clinical studies were carried out to investigate pharmacokinetic drug interactions in vivo with gefitinib.
In preclinical studies radiolabelled gefitinib was incubated with: (i) hepatic microsomal protein in the presence of selective CYP inhibitors; and (ii) expressed CYP enzymes.
Human hepatic microsomal protein was incubated with selective CYP substrates in the presence of gefitinib.
Clinical studies were all phase I, open-label, single-centre studies; two had a randomised, two-way crossover design and the third was nonrandomised.
The first and second studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in the presence of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin [rifampin]) or inhibitor (itraconazole) in healthy male volunteers.
The third study investigated the effects that gefitinib had on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, a CYP2D6 substrate, in patients with solid tumours.
The results of preclinical studies demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of gefitinib and that gefitinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity.
There was no apparent change in the safety profile of gefitinib as a result of coadministration with other agents.
Although CYP3A4 inducers may reduce exposure to gefitinib, further work is required to define any resultant effect on the efficacy of gefitinib.
Exposure to gefitinib is increased by coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors, but since gefitinib is known to have a good tolerability profile, a dosage reduction is not recommended.
Gefitinib is unlikely to exert a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism for their clearance, but the potential to increase plasma concentrations should be considered if gefitinib is coadministered with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index or are individually dose titrated.
In clinical studies when gefitinib was administered in the presence of rifampicin, geometric mean (gmean) maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were reduced by 65% and 83%, respectively; these changes were statistically significant.
When gefitinib was administered in the presence of itraconazole, gmean AUC increased by 78% and 61% at gefitinib doses of 250 and 500 mg, respectively; these changes also being statistically significant.
Coadministration of metoprolol with gefitinib resulted in a 35% increase in the metoprolol area under plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration; this change was not statistically significant.
Clinical pharmacokinetics of telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial.
Telithromycin is the first ketolide, which is a new class of antibacterial agents related to the macrolides that have structural modifications permitting dual binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA so that activity is retained against Streptococcus pneumoniae with macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin(B) resistance.
Clinical experience in infectious patients has shown that oral telithromycin 800mg once daily for 5-10 days is effective for the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
Absorption of telithromycin in humans is estimated to be > or = 90%.
Prior to entering the systemic circulation, telithromycin undergoes first-pass metabolism (mainly by the liver).
Its absolute bioavailability is 57% and is unaffected by food.
The volume of distribution of telithromycin after intravenous infusion is 2.9 L/kg.
Telithromycin is 60-70% bound to serum proteins and has extensive diffusion into a range of target biological tissues, achieving concentrations above its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against key respiratory pathogens throughout the dosing interval.
After entering the systemic circulation, telithromycin is eliminated by multiple pathways (7% by biliary and/or intestinal excretion, 13% by renal excretion and 37% by hepatic metabolism).
Telithromycin is metabolised via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and non-CYP pathways.
The identified metabolites show minimal antibacterial activity compared with the parent drug.
In healthy subjects receiving telithromycin 800 mg once daily, the peak plasma concentration achieved is 2.27 microg/mL.
Plasma concentrations of telithromycin show a biphasic decrease over time, with an initial disposition half-life of 2.9 hours and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 10 hours after multiple dose administration.
Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 2-3 days of once-daily administration.
Owing to elimination by multiple pathways there is a small increase in exposure when one of these elimination pathways is impaired, as indicated by the results of studies in special patient populations (e.g. those with hepatic or renal impairment).
Dosage reductions may be recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.
The potential for telithromycin to inhibit the CYP3A4 pathway is similar to that of clarithromycin.
The once-daily administration of telithromycin is likely to limit the potential for drug interactions and clinically significant increases in exposure.
In phase III clinical trials, the telithromycin 800 mg once-daily dose has been shown to provide close to the maximum antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
In conclusion, telithromycin has a well characterised and reproducible pharmacokinetic profile, with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships supporting an oral dosage regimen of 800 mg once daily.
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by potent inhibitors such as itraconazole and ketoconazole results in a 54% and 95% increase in telithromycin area under the plasma concentration-time curve, respectively.
Interaction between amlodipine and simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are often prescribed in association with antihypertensive agents, including calcium antagonists.
Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.
The calcium antagonist amlodipine is also metabolized by CYP3A4.
The purpose of this study was to investigate drug interactions between amlodipine and simvastatin.
Eight patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were enrolled.
They were given 4 weeks of oral simvastatin (5 mg/day), followed by 4 weeks of oral amlodipine (5 mg/day) co-administered with simvastatin (5 mg/day).
This study is the first to determine prospectively the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between amlodipine and simvastatin.
Combined treatment with simvastatin and amlodipine increased the peak concentration (C(max)) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors from 9.6 +/- 3.7 ng/ml to 13.7 +/- 4.7 ng/ml (p < 0.05) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 34.3 +/- 16.5 ng h/ml to 43.9 +/- 16.6 ng h/ml (p < 0.05) without affecting the cholesterol-lowering effect of simvastatin.
Rifampin markedly decreases and gemfibrozil increases the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites.
The pharmacokinetic interactions of the widely used statin atorvastatin with fibrates and enzyme inducers are not known.
Therefore we studied the effects of rifampin (INN, rifampicin) and gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.
Two randomized crossover studies were conducted.
In study 1, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg rifampin or placebo once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, they ingested a single 40-mg dose of atorvastatin.
In study 2, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily for 5 days.
On day 3, they ingested a single 20-mg dose of atorvastatin.
Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin (in nanograms per milliliter) and its metabolites (in arbitrary units) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry up to 48 to 72 hours after dosing.
It is advisable to increase the dosage of atorvastatin and preferable to administer it in the evening to guarantee adequate concentrations during the nighttime rapid cholesterol synthesis when rifampin or other potent inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 are coadministered.
Care is warranted, and only low doses of atorvastatin should be used if coadministration with gemfibrozil is needed.
Rifampin reduced the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of unchanged atorvastatin (acid) by 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73% to 84%; P < .001), that of the active metabolites 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 43% (95% CI, 29% to 51%; P < .001) and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid by 81% (95% CI, 74% to 84%; P < .001), and that of their lactones by 93% (95% CI, 90% to 95%), by 61% (95% CI, 50% to 69%), and by 76% (95% CI, 70% to 81%), respectively (P < .001).
The peak plasma concentration of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid was increased by 68% (95% CI, 21% to 127%; P = .005) by rifampin.
Rifampin shortened (P < .001) the half-lives of atorvastatin (by 74%; 95% CI, 67% to 81%) and its metabolites, for example, atorvastatin lactone (by 82%; 95% CI, 80% to 85%) and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 70%; 95% CI, 64% to 78%).
Gemfibrozil increased the AUC of atorvastatin (by 24%; 95% CI, -1% to 50%; P =.059), 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 51%; 95% CI, 28% to 70%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 29%; 95% CI, 13% to 53%; P =.003), and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (by 82%; 95% CI, 60% to 126%; P < .001) and its lactone (by 28%; 95% CI, 15% to 51%; P =.001).
The half-lives of atorvastatin and its lactone metabolites were slightly shortened by gemfibrozil (P < .05).
Rifampin markedly decreases and gemfibrozil moderatelyincreases the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolites.
Effect of probenecid on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine in healthy subjects.
Carbamazepine (CBZ) undergoes biotransformation by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, and glucuronide conjugation.
There has been no clear demonstration to reveal the role of glucuronidation in the disposition of CBZ.
We evaluated the effect of probenecid, a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of CBZ in humans.
In a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study, ten healthy male subjects were treated twice daily for 10 days with 500 mg probenecid or with a matched placebo.
On day 6, a single dose of 200 mg CBZ was administered orally.
Concentrations of CBZ and CBZ 10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) in plasma and urine were measured.
However, probenecid had minimal effect on the recovery of the conjugated and free forms of CBZ and CBZ-E in urine.
Although probenecid showed a minimal effect on the glucuronidation of CBZ and CBZ-E, it increased CBZ biotransformation to CBZ-E, most likely reflecting the induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 activities, in humans.
Probenecid decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of CBZ from 1253.9 micromol h/l to 1020.7 micromol h/l (P < 0.001) while increasing that of CBZ-E from 137.6 micromol h/l to 183.5 micromol h/l (P = 0.033).
The oral clearance of CBZ was increased by probenecid by 26% (90% confidence interval, 17-34%; P < 0.001).
Probenecid increased the AUC ratio of CBZ-E/CBZ from 0.11 to 0.16 (P < 0.001).
These results demonstrate that glucuronide conjugation plays a minor role in the metabolism of CBZ and CBZ-E in humans, and that probenecid has an inducing effect on the disposition of CBZ.
Ketoconazole increases plasma concentrations of antimalarial mefloquine in healthy human volunteers.
Antimalarial mefloquine has a structure related to quinine.
The major metabolite of quinine is 3-hydroxyquinine formed by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).
Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, is known to markedly increase plasma concentrations of various co-administered drugs including quinine.
To assess the effect of ketoconazole on plasma concentrations of mefloquine in healthy Thai male volunteers.
In an open, randomized two-phase crossover study separated by a 1-month period, eight healthy Thai male volunteers received a single oral dose of 500 mg mefloquine alone or co-administration with 400 mg/day ketoconazole orally for 10 days.
Serial blood samples were collected at specific time points for a 56-day period.
Plasma mefloquine and mefloquine carboxylic metabolite concentrations during 56 days were measured by a modified and validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection.
In case of mefloquine is co-administered with ketoconazole, drug-drug interactions should be recognized and the dose of mefloquine should be adjusted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy and to reduce the cost of therapy.
Co-administration with ketoconazole markedly increased the mean values of mefloquine AUC0-t, t(1/2), and Cmax when compared with mefloquine alone by 79% (P < 0.001), 39% (P < 0.05) and 64% (P < 0.001) respectively.
The AUC0-t , and Cmax of mefloquine carboxylic acid metabolite were decreased by 28% (P < 0.05) and 31% (P < 0.05), respectively when compared with mefloquine alone.
Co-administration with ketoconazole increased plasma mefloquine concentrations in healthy human volunteers.
One of possible mechanisms of the increase in plasma mefloquine concentrations may be the result of the inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole.
The effect of erythromycin and fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous lidocaine.
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4) have a minor effect on lidocaine pharmacokinetics.
We studied the effect of coadministration of the antidepressant fluvoxamine (CYP1A2 inhibitor) and antimicrobial drug erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor) on lidocaine pharmacokinetics in a double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover study.
Nine volunteers ingested daily 100 mg fluvoxamine and placebo, 100 mg fluvoxamine and 1500 mg erythromycin, or their corresponding placebos for 5 days.
On day 6, 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine was administered IV over 60 min.
Concentrations of lidocaine and its major metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide were measured for 10 h.
During the combination phase the half-life of lidocaine (4.3 h) was longer than during the placebo (2.6 h; P < 0.001) or fluvoxamine (3.5 h; P < 0.01).
Fluvoxamine alone decreased the clearance of lidocaine by 41% (P < 0.001) and prolonged its elimination half-life from .6 to 3.5 h (P < 0.01)2.
During the combination of fluvoxamine and erythromycin, lidocaine clearance was 53% smaller than during placebo (P < 0.001) and 21% smaller than during fluvoxamine alone (P < 0.05).
We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine considerably reduces elimination of lidocaine and may increase the risk of lidocaine toxicity.
Concomitant use of both fluvoxamine and a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as erythromycin can further increase plasma lidocaine concentrations by decreasing its clearance.
Effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic warfarin in healthy subjects.
Case reports suggest that gemfobrozil can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Because gemfibrozil inhibits CYP2C9 in vitro, we studied its effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic warfarin.
In a randomized cross-over study, 10 healthy subjects ingested 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily for 8 days.
On day 3, they were administered a single dose of 10 mg racemic R-S-warfarin orally.
The concentrations of R- and S-warfarin in plasma and thromboplastin time were monitored up to 168 h. "
There were no significant differences in the elimination half-lives of S- or R-warfarin between the phases.
Displacement of warfarin from plasma albumin by gemfibrozil or its interference with the absorption of warfarin could explain the present findings.
Usual therapeutic doses of gemfibrozil seem to have limited effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single dose warfarin in healthy subjects.
Gemfibrozil decreased the mean (+/-SD) area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC((0-infinity))] of S-warfarin by 11%, from 19.9 +/- 5.2 mg l(-1) h to 17.6 +/- 4.7 mg l(-1) h (95% CI on the difference -3.7, -0.78; P < 0.01) and that of R-warfarin by 6% from 31.3 +/- 7.5 mg l(-1) h during the gemfibrozil phase to 29.5 +/- 6.9 mg l(-1) h during the placebo phase (95% CI -3.3, -0.33; P < 0.05).
Gemfibrozil did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Unexpectedly, gemfibrozil slightly decreased the plasma concentrations of R- and S-warfarin.
Influence of itraconazole co-administration and CYP2D6 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the new antipsychotic ARIPIPRAZOLE.
The results of in vitro studies indicated that ARIPIPRAZOLE, a newly developed antipsychotic, is mainly metabolized by the human cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.
The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of itraconazole (hereafter referred to as ITZ) co-administration (CYP3A4 inhibition) on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE administered to 24 healthy adult male volunteers in a fasting condition.
The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition was also examined by CYP2D6 genotype.
All subjects were administered a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE alone in Period I and a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE following administration of ITZ at 100 mg/day for 7 consecutive days in Period II.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ARIPIPRAZOLE and its main metabolite OPC-14857 were determined.
For the co-administration period, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in intermediate metabolizers was about half of that in extensive metabolizers.
For Cmax, there was no significant difference between extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers, and the percent change by co-administration of ITZ was less than 20% in both extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers.
For OPC-14857, the t(max) in intermediate metabolizers was longer than that in extensive metabolizers, with the difference being amplified by co-administration of ITZ.
The AUC336 hr showed similar increases by co-administration of ITZ in all genotypes.
The urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentration ratio following ITZ administration for 7 consecutive days was about half of that before the start of ITZ administration, indicating that CYP3A4 metabolic activity was inhibited by administration of ITZ.
The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE was not considered to be clinically significant.
On the other hand, definite differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between CYP2D6 genotypes.
Co-administration of ITZ increased the Cmax, AUC336 hr, and t1/2,z of ARIPIPRAZOLE and OPC-14857 by 19.4%, 48.0%, and 18.6% and by 18.6%, 38.8%, and 53.4%, respectively.
By co-administration of ITZ, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in extensive metabolizers was decreased by 26.6%, with an even greater decrease (47.3%,.) in intermediate metabolizers.
Effects of itraconazole or grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of telithromycin.
To determine whether coadministration of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors itraconazole or grapefruit juice will modify the pharmacokinetic profile of telithromycin, and to assess the safety of telithromycin.
Two single-center, open-label studies; the itraconazole study was nonrandomized, sequential, and multiple dose, and the grapefruit juice study was randomized, two-period crossover, and single dose.
Two clinical investigative centers in the United States.
Thirty-four healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 18-45 years.
All patients received telithromycin 800 mg/day; 18 patients received concomitant itraconazole 200 mg/day, and 16 received concomitant single-dose, single-strength grapefruit juice.
Standard pharmacokinetic and safety measurements were performed.
Itraconazole given concomitantly with telithromycin increased the steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours of telithromycin by 53.8% (p<0.0001).
Coadministration of grapefruit juice did not affect telithromycin pharmacokinetic parameters, and telithromycin was well tolerated in both studies.
Only modest changes in the pharmacokinetics of telithromycin were seen with concomitant administration of itraconazole.
Telithromycin pharmacokinetics were unaffected by concomitant administration of grapefruit juice.
The effect of trimethoprim on CYP2C8 mediated rosiglitazone metabolism in human liver microsomes and healthy subjects.
Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic medication used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP2C8.
The anti-infective drug trimethoprim has been shown in vitro to be a selective inhibitor of CYP2C8.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of trimethoprim on the CYP2C8 mediated metabolism of rosiglitazone in vivo and in vitro.
The effect of trimethoprim on the metabolism of rosiglitazone in vitro was assessed in pooled human liver microsomes.
The effect in vivo was determined by evaluating rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics in the presence and absence of trimethoprim.
Eight healthy subjects (four men and four women) completed a randomized, cross-over study.
Subjects received single dose rosiglitazone (8 mg) in the presence and absence of trimethoprim 200 mg given twice daily for 5 days.
Trimethoprim reduced the para-O-sulphate rosiglitazone/rosiglitazone and the N-desmethylrosiglitazone/rosiglitazone AUC(0-24) ratios by 22% and 38%, respectively.
Trimethoprim inhibited rosiglitazone metabolism both in vitro and in vivo.
Inhibition of rosiglitazone para-hydroxylation by trimethoprim in vitro was found to be competitive with apparent K(i) and IC(50) values of 29 microm and 54.5 microm, respectively.
In the presence of trimethoprim, rosiglitazone plasma AUC was increased by 31% (P = 0.01) from 2774 +/- 645 microg l(-1) h to 3643 +/- 1051 microg l(-1) h (95% confidence interval (CI) for difference 189, 1549), and half-life was increased by 27% (P = 0.006) from 3.3 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.8 h (95% CI for difference 0.36, 1.5).
These results indicate that trimethoprim is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated rosiglitazone metabolism in vitro and that trimethoprim administration increases plasma rosiglitazone concentrations in healthy subjects.
Ciprofloxacin greatly increases concentrations and hypotensive effect of tizanidine by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 1A2-mediated presystemic metabolism.
Tizanidine, a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant, is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and has a low oral bioavailability.
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin is only a moderately potent inhibitor of CYP1A2.
Our objective was to study the extent and mechanism of a possible interaction of ciprofloxacin with tizanidine.
In a double-blind, randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers ingested 500 mg ciprofloxacin or placebo twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, a single dose of 4 mg tizanidine was ingested 1 hour after the morning dose of ciprofloxacin.
Plasma concentrations of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin and pharmacodynamic variables were measured.
A caffeine test was used as a marker for CYP1A2 activity.
The AUC(0-infinity) of tizanidine and its change correlated (P < .01) with the caffeine/paraxanthine ratio and its change.
Tizanidine seems to be a useful probe drug for measuring presystemic metabolism by CYP1A2.
Care should be exercised when tizanidine is used concomitantly with ciprofloxacin.
Ciprofloxacin increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] of tizanidine by 10-fold (range, 6-fold to 24-fold; P < .001)and its peak concentration by 7-fold (range, 4-fold to 21-fold; P < .001), whereas its elimination half-life was only prolonged from 1.5 to 1.8 hours (P = .007).
The pharmacodynamic effects of tizanidine were much stronger during the ciprofloxacin phase than during the placebo phase with regard to changes in systolic blood pressure (-35 mm Hg versus -15 mm Hg, P = .001), diastolic blood pressure (-24 mm Hg versus -11 mm Hg, P < .001), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P = .02), subjective drug effect (P = .002), and subjective drowsiness (P = .009).
Ciprofloxacin greatly elevates plasma concentrations of tizanidine and dangerously potentiates its hypotensive and sedative effects, mainly by inhibiting its CYP1A2-mediated metabolism, at least when administered 1 hour before tizanidine.
Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with cytochrome P450 inhibitors.
Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia.
Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure.
Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects.
Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and atorvastatin.
Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics.
However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001).
Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60%increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil.
The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC).
Clarithromycin significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin ( approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold).
Effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in healthy subjects.
Fungal infection is a significant comorbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus, and ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, causes a number of drug interactions with coadministered drugs.
Rosiglitazone is a novel thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9.
We investigated the possible effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in humans.
Ten healthy Korean male volunteers were treated twice daily for 5 days with 200 mg ketoconazole or with placebo, using a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study.
On day 5, a single dose of 8 mg rosiglitazone was administered orally, and plasma rosiglitazone concentrations were measured.
Ketoconazole increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for rosiglitazone by 47% [P = 0.0003; 95% confidence interval (CI) 23, 70] and the mean elimination half-life from 3.55 to 5.50 h (P = 0.0003; 95% CI in difference 1.1, 2.4).
The peak plasma concentration of rosiglitazone was increased by ketoconazole treatment by 17% (P = 0.03; 95% CI 5, 29).
The apparent oral clearance of rosiglitazone decreased by 28% after ketoconazole treatment (P = 0.0005; 95% CI 18, 38).
This study revealed that ketoconazole affected the disposition of rosiglitazone in humans, probably by the inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, leading to increasing rosiglitazone concentrations that could increase the efficacy of rosiglitazone or its adverse events.
Effects of trimethoprim and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of the cytochrome P450 2C8 substrate rosiglitazone.
Trimethoprim is a relatively selective inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme in vitro.
Rifampin (INN, rifampicin) is a potent inducer of several CYP enzymes, and in vitro studies have suggested that it also induces CYP2C8.
Our aims were to investigate possible effects of trimethoprim and rifampin on CYP2C8 activity by use of rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug metabolized primarily by CYP2C8, as an in vivo probe.
Two separate randomized crossover studies with 2 phases were conducted.
In study 1, 10 healthy volunteers took 160 mg trimethoprim or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days.
On day 3, they ingested a single 4-mg dose of rosiglitazone.
In study 2, 10 healthy volunteers took 600 mg rifampin or placebo orally once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, they ingested a single 4-mg dose of rosiglitazone.
In both studies, plasma rosiglitazone and N -desmethylrosiglitazone concentrations were measured for up to 48 hours.
Trimethoprim reduced the formation of N -desmethylrosiglitazone.
Rifampin increased the formation of N -desmethylrosiglitazone.
Results In study 1, trimethoprim raised the area under the plasma rosiglitazone concentration-time curve [AUC(0- infinity )] by 37% (range, 16% to 51%; P <.0001) and the peak plasma rosiglitazone concentration (C max ) by 14% (range, -3% to 38%; P =.0014).
The elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of rosiglitazone was prolonged from 3.8 to 4.8 hours ( P =.0013).
In study 2, rifampin reduced the AUC(0- infinity ) and C max of rosiglitazone by 54% (range, 46% to 63%; P <.0001) and 28% (range, 2% to 56%; P =.0003), respectively.
The t 1/2 of rosiglitazone was shortened from 3.8 to 1.9 hours ( P <.0001).
Trimethoprim raises and rifampin reduces the plasma concentrations of rosiglitazone by inhibiting and inducing, respectively, the CYP2C8-catalyzed biotransformation of rosiglitazone.
Effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous midazolam during inhibited and induced metabolic states.
Our objective was to investigate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the systemic clearance of midazolam in constitutive, inhibited, and induced metabolic conditions.
Nineteen healthy volunteers were grouped with regard to the CYP3A5*3 allele, into homozygous wild-type (CYP3A5*1/*1, n = 6), heterozygous (CYP3A5*1/*3, n = 6), and homozygous variant-type (CYP3A5*3/*3, n = 7) subject groups.
The pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous midazolam was characterized before and after itraconazole administration (200 mg once daily for 4 days) and also after rifampin (INN, rifampicin) pretreatment (600 mg once daily for 10 days), with a washout period of 2 weeks in between.
The pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam and of its hydroxy metabolites did not show differences between the genotype groups under basal and induced metabolic conditions.
However, during the inhibited metabolic state, the CYP3A5*3/*3 group showed a greater decrease in systemic clearance than was seen in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (8.5 +/- 3.8 L. h(-1).70 kg(-1) versus 13.5 +/- 2.7 L. h(-1).70 kg(-1), P =.027).
The 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to-midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio was also significantly lower in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group (0.58 +/- 0.35 versus 1.09 +/- 0.37 for the homozygous wild-type group, P =.026).
The CYP3A5 genotype did not affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenous midazolam in the basal or induced states.
However, during cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition by itraconazole, individuals carrying the CYP3A5*1 allele were found to be less susceptible to changes in systemic clearance and showed higher 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to-midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios, probably resulting from the relatively CYP3A4-specific inhibition caused by itraconazole.
Effect of lansoprazole and rabeprazole on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers with CYP2C19 mutations.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), lansoprazole and rabeprazole, on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers with mutations in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 gene (CYP2C19).
An open-label crossover study was performed with 19 healthy subjects.
Tacrolimus (2 mg) was administered orally with and without lansoprazole (30 mg per day for 4 days) or rabeprazole (10 mg per day for 4 days).
Blood concentrations of tacrolimus were determined before and 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after dosing.
Genotyping for CYP2C19 was conducted by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
The percent change for tacrolimus AUC0-8 in subjects with and without CYP2C19 mutant alleles was 81% and 29%, respectively.
These observations suggest that drug interaction between tacrolimus and lansoprazole occurs in subjects with higher lansoprazole blood concentrations corresponding to CYP2C19 genetic status.
In contrast, rabeprazole has minimal effect on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics regardless of CYP2C19 genotype status.
Coadministration of lansoprazole significantly decreased the oral tacrolimus clearance, resulting in an increase in the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC0-8) (control vs with lansoprazole: 29.7 +/- 3.5 vs 44.1 +/- 5.0 ng h mL(-1), P < 0.05).
Large individual variation was observed in the effects of lansoprazole on tacrolimus AUC0-8 owing to CYP2C19 genotype status.
Coadministration of rabeprazole also increased the mean AUC0-8 of tacrolimus, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Effects of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of methadone.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the main CYP isozyme involved in methadone metabolism.
We investigated the influence of grapefruit juice, which contains inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of methadone.
For 5 days, 8 patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment received 200 mL water or grapefruit juice 30 minutes before and again together with their daily dose of methadone.
Blood sampling for R-, S-, and R,S-methadone plasma determination was performed over a 24-hour period.
CYP3A activity was determined by measuring the plasma 1'-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam ratio.
A similar increase in peak level and decrease in apparent clearance were measured with grapefruit juice, whereas time to peak level, terminal half-life, and apparent volume during the terminal phase of R-, S-, and R,S-methadone were not affected by grapefruit juice.
No symptom of overmedication was either detected by the clinical staff or reported by the patients.
However, it cannot be excluded that a much stronger effect may occur in some patients, and thus grapefruit juice intake is not recommended during methadone maintenance treatment, in particular in patients initiating such a treatment.
A decrease in the midazolam ratio was measured in all patients after grapefruit juice (mean +/- SD before grapefruit juice, 9.3 +/- 5.9; mean +/- SD after grapefruit juice, 3.9 +/- 1.2; P <.05).
Grapefruit juice led to a mean 17% increase in the area under the curve extrapolated to 24 hours for both enantiomers of methadone (range, 3% to 29% [P <.005]; range, -4% to 37% [P <.05]; and range, 1% to 32% [P <.01]; for R-, S-, and R,S-methadone, respectively).
Grapefruit juice administration is associated with a modest increase in methadone bioavailability, which is not expected to endanger patients.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between ketoconazole and imatinib mesylate (Glivec) in healthy subjects.
The study under discussion was a drug-drug interaction study in which the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of Glivec (imatinib) was investigated.
A total of 14 healthy subjects (13 male, 1 female) were enrolled in this study.
Each subject received a single oral dose of imatinib 200 mg alone, and a single oral dose of imatinib 200 mg coadministered with a single oral dose of ketoconazole 400 mg according to a two-period crossover design.
The treatment sequence was randomly allocated.
Subtherapeutic imatinib doses and a short exposure were tested in order not to overexpose the healthy volunteers.
There was a minimum 7-day washout period between the two sequences.
Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations were taken up to 96 h after dosing.
Imatinib and CGP74588 (main metabolite of imatinib) concentrations were measured using LC/MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a non-compartmental analysis.
Given its previously demonstrated safety profile, this increased exposure to imatinib is likely to be clinically significant only at high doses.
This interaction should be considered when administering inhibitors of the CYP3A family in combination with imatinib.
Following ketoconazole coadministration, the mean imatinib C(max), AUC((0-24)) and AUC((0- infinity )) increased significantly by 26% ( P<0.005), 40% ( P<0.0005) and 40% ( P <0.0005), respectively.
There was a statistically significant decrease in apparent clearance (CL/F) of imatinib with a mean reduction of 28.6% ( P<0.0005).
The mean C(max) and AUC((0-24)) of the metabolite CGP74588 decreased significantly by 22.6% ( P<0.005) and 13% ( P<0.05) after ketoconazole treatment, although the AUC((0- infinity )) of CGP74588 only decreased by 5% ( P=0.28).
Coadministration of ketoconazole and imatinib caused a 40% increase in exposure to imatinib in healthy volunteers.
Effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.
In vitro studies indicate that the anticancer drug docetaxel is primarily eliminated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism.
Coadministration of drugs that modulate the activity of CYP3A4 is, therefore, likely to have undesirable clinical consequences.
We investigated the effects of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in patients with cancer.
Seven patients were treated in a randomized crossover design with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)), followed 3 weeks later by docetaxel (10 mg/m(2)) given in combination with orally administered ketoconazole (200 mg once daily for 3 days), or the reverse sequence.
Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis.
The docetaxel clearance ratio in the presence and absence of ketoconazole was weakly related to the area under the curve of ketoconazole (R(2) = 0.529, P =.064).
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole in vivo results in docetaxel clearance values that have previously been shown to be associated with a several-fold increase in the odds for febrile neutropenia at standard doses.
Caution should be taken and substantial dose reductions are required if docetaxel has to be administered together with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4.
Ketoconazole coadministration resulted in a 49% decrease in clearance of docetaxel (P =.018).
The mean (+/-SD) clearance values were 35.0 +/- 11.8 L/h (95% confidence interval, 24.1-45.9 L/h) for docetaxel alone and 18.2 L/h (95% confidence interval, 9.22-27.1 L/h) in the presence of ketoconazole, respectively.
Fluvoxamine drastically increases concentrations and effects of tizanidine: a potentially hazardous interaction.
Our objective was to study the effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tizanidine, a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.
In a double-blind, randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 100 mg fluvoxamine or placebo orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 4-mg dose of tizanidine.
Plasma concentrations of tizanidine and fluvoxamine and pharmacodynamic variables were measured.
A caffeine test was performed on day 3 to examine the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in tizanidine pharmacokinetics.
All pharmacodynamic variables revealed a significant difference between the fluvoxamine and placebo phases, eg, in the maximal effects on systolic blood pressure (-35 mm Hg, P =.000009), diastolic blood pressure (-20 mm Hg, P =.00002), heart rate (-4 beats/min, P =.007), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (P =.0003), subjective drug effect (P =.0000001), and drowsiness (P =.0002).
In particular, the decrease in systolic blood pressure, to the level of 80 mm Hg or even less, was an alarming finding.
Inhibition of tizanidine-metabolizing enzyme(s), mainly CYP1A2, by fluvoxamine seems to explain the observed interaction.
Because of the potentially hazardous consequences, the concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, or other potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, should be avoided.
On average, fluvoxamine increased the total area under the concentration-time curve [AUC(0- infinity )] of tizanidine 33-fold (range, 14-fold to 103-fold; P =.000002) and the peak plasma concentration 12-fold (range, 5-fold to 32-fold; P =.000001).
The mean elimination half-life of tizanidine was prolonged from 1.5 to 4.3 hours (P =.00004) by fluvoxamine.
The AUC(0- infinity ) of tizanidine and its increase by fluvoxamine correlated with the caffeine/paraxanthine ratio and its increase, respectively (P <.03).
Fluvoxamine seriously affects the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine and increases the intensity and duration of its effects.
rifampicin seems to act as both an inducer and an inhibitor of the metabolism of repaglinide.
To investigate if rifampicin is both an inducer and an inhibitor of repaglinide metabolism, it was determined whether the timing of rifampicin co-administration influences the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide.
Male volunteers ( n=12) participated in a randomised, two-period, crossover trial evaluating the effect of multiple doses of 600 mg rifampicin once daily for 7 days on repaglinide metabolism.
Subjects were, after baseline measurements of repaglinide pharmacokinetics, randomised to receive, on either day 7 or day 8 of the rifampicin administration period, a single dose of 4 mg repaglinide and vice versa in the following period.
Neither the peak plasma concentration (C(max)), time to reach C(max) (t(max)) nor terminal half-life (t(1/2)) was statistically significantly affected.
The median C(max) was now statistically significantly reduced from 35 ng/ml to 7.5 ng/ml.
Neither t(max) nor t(1/2) was significantly affected.
After discontinuing rifampicin administration, while the inductive effect on CYP3A4 and probably also CYP2C8 is still present, an even more marked reduction in the plasma concentration of repaglinide was observed.
Our results suggest that concomitant administration of rifampicin and repaglinide may cause a clinically relevant decrease in the glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide, in particular when rifampicin treatment is discontinued or if the drugs are not administered simultaneously or within a few hours of each other.
When repaglinide was given, together with the last rifampicin dose, on day 7, an almost 50% reduction of the median repaglinide area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was observed.
When repaglinide was given on day 8, 24 h after the last rifampicin dose, an almost 80% reduction of the median repaglinide AUC was observed.
When rifampicin and repaglinide are administered concomitantly, rifampicin seems to act as both an inducer and an inhibitor of the metabolism of repaglinide.
Different inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on omeprazole metabolism between CYP2C19 genotypes.
Omeprazole is mainly metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19.
The inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19 as well as CYP1A2, on the metabolism of omeprazole was compared between different genotypes for CYP2C19.
Eighteen volunteers, of whom six were homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), six were heterozygous EMs and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study.
A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed.
All subjects received two six-day courses of either daily 50 mg fluvoxamine or placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral 40 mg dose of omeprazole on day six in both cases.
Plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulphone, and fluvoxamine were monitored up to 8 h after the dosing.
During placebo administration, geometric means of peak concentration (C(max)), under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h (AUC(0,8 h)) and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of omeprazole were 900 ng ml(-1), 1481 ng ml(-1) h, and 0.6 h in homozygous EMs, 1648 ng ml(-1), 4225 ng ml(-1) h, and 1.1 h in heterozygous EMs, and 2991 ng ml(-1), 11537 ng ml(-1) h, and 2.8 h in PMs, respectively.
However, no pharmacokinetic parameters were changed in PMs.
Even a low dose of fluvoxamine increased omeprazole exposure in EMs, but did not increase omeprazole exposure in PMs after a single oral dose of omeprazole.
These findings confirm a potent inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on CYP2C19 activity.
Fluvoxamine treatment increased C(max) of omeprazole by 3.7-fold (95%CI, 2.4, 5.0-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.0-fold (1.4, 2.6-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0,8 h) by 6.0-fold (3.3, 8.7-fold, P < 0.001) and 2.4-fold (1.7, 3.2-fold, P < 0.01), AUC(0, infinity ) by 6.2-fold (3.0, 9.3-fold, P < 0.01) and 2.5-fold (1.6, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and prolonged t((1/2)) by 2.6-fold (1.9, 3.4-fold, P < 0.001) and 1.4-fold (1.02, 1.7-fold, P < 0.05), respectively.
The AUC(0,8 h) ratios of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to omeprazole were decreased with fluvoxamine in homozygous EMs (P < 0.05) and heterozygous EMs (P < 0.01).
The bioavailability of omeprazole might, to some extent, be increased through inhibition of P-glycoprotein during fluvoxamine treatment.
The CYP2C8 inhibitor trimethoprim increases the plasma concentrations of repaglinide in healthy subjects.
Our aim was to investigate the effect of the CYP2C8 inhibitor trimethoprim on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antidiabetic drug repaglinide, and to examine the influence of the former on the metabolism of the latter in vitro.
In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with two phases, nine healthy volunteers took 160 mg trimethoprim or placebo orally twice daily for 3 days.
On day 3, 1 h after the last dose of trimethoprim or placebo, they ingested a single 0.25 mg dose of repaglinide.
Plasma repaglinide and blood glucose concentrations were measured for up to 7 h post-dose.
In addition, the effect of trimethoprim on the metabolism of repaglinide by human liver microsomes was investigated.
Trimethoprim had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of its aromatic amine metabolite (M1), but decreased the M1 : repaglinide AUC(0, infinity ) ratio by 38% (P = 0.0005).
In vitro, trimethoprim inhibited the metabolism of (220 nm) repaglinide in a concentration-dependent manner.
Although the interaction did not significantly enhance the effect of repaglinide on blood glucose concentration at the drug doses used, the possibility of an increased risk of hypoglycaemia should be considered during concomitant use of trimethoprim and repaglinide in patients with diabetes.
Trimethoprim raised the AUC(0, infinity ) and C(max) of repaglinide by 61% (range, 30-117%; P= 0.0008) and 41% (P = 0.005.), respectively, and prolonged the t((1/2)) of repaglinide from 0.9 to 1.1 h (P = 0.001).
No effect of trimethoprim on the blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide was detectable.
Trimethoprim raised the plasma concentrations of repaglinide probably by inhibiting its CYP2C8-mediated biotransformation.
Effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in healthy subjects.
Rifampin (INN, rifampicin) causes several drug interactions with coadministered antidiabetic drugs.
Rosiglitazone is a novel thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, but little is known about the drug interaction between rifampin and rosiglitazone.
Our objective was to investigate the effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone in humans.
In an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study, 10 healthy Korean male subjects were treated once daily for 6 days with 600 mg rifampin or with placebo.
On day 7, a single dose of 8 mg rosiglitazone was administered orally.
Plasma rosiglitazone concentrations were measured.
Rifampin significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for rosiglitazone by 65% (2947.9 ng.h/mL versus 991.5 ng.h/mL, P <.001) and the mean elimination half-life from 3.9 to 1.5 hours (P <.001).
The peak plasma concentration of rosiglitazone was significantly decreased by rifampin (537.7 ng/mL versus 362.3 ng/mL, P <.01).
The apparent oral clearance of rosiglitazone increased about 3-fold after rifampin treatment (2.8 L/h versus 8.5 L/h, P <.001).
This study showed that rifampin affected the disposition of rosiglitazone in humans, probably by the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9.
Therefore caution should be exercised during the coadministration of rifampin and rosiglitazone.
Pharmacokinetic interactions between omeprazole/pantoprazole and clarithromycin in health volunteers.
The association omeprazole/clarithromycin is of current wide use in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori associated gastroduodenal ulcer.
This combination may result in increased levels of omeprazole with potential interactions with commonly associated drugs.
Kinetic/metabolic changes occurring after omeprazole/clarithromycin were compared to those occurring after pantoprazole/clarithromycin in healthy volunteers.
Eight healthy volunteers, all males, age 25-34 years, all EM for CYP2C19, participated in a randomized, double blind crossover study in two periods of 7 days, separated by a 14-day washout.
In each treatment period, subjects took either omeprazole 20mg b.i.d. together with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., or pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d. with the same dose of the antibiotic.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of omeprazole and pantoprazole were compared to those after intake of both agents alone.
Kinetics of unchanged clarithromycin was evaluated at the end of the two periods.
Kinetics of clarithromycin did not differ after the two associated treatments.
The administration of clarithromycin with two different proton pump inhibitors indicates that the antibiotic can markedly increase omeprazole, not pantoprazole, levels.
This observation may result in a better therapeutic response to omeprazole, but it may also potentially affect either the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates or interfere with the absorption of drugs requiring an intact gastric digestion system.
The mean value of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of unchanged omeprazole increased almost two-fold after concomitant administration of clarithromycin; the average 5-OH-omeprazole AUC was instead significantly reduced by 42%.
Omeprazole clearance and volume of distribution were reduced significantly by 75 and 56%, respectively, after administration of the drug with clarithromicyn.
No significant changes of the kinetic of pantoprazole and metabolites were observed.
Influence of rifampicin pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in healthy male volunteers.
The effect of rifampicin pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib was investigated in 12 healthy male human volunteers.
After an overnight fast, celecoxib 200 mg was administered to the volunteers, either alone or after 5 days pretreatment with once daily dose of 600 mg rifampicin.
Serum concentrations of celecoxib were estimated by reverse phase HPLC.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on non-compartmental model analysis using the computer program KINETICA.
However, time to reach peak concentration, tmax (4 +/- 0.88 vs 4 +/- 0.83 h) and volume of distribution Vd/f (583 +/- 251 vs 710 +/- 690 l/kg) were not affected significantly.
This may be due to increased metabolism of celecoxib due to the induction of cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) in liver.
This interaction has a significant clinical relevance and may warrant dosage adjustment when celecoxib is co-administered with rifampicin in chronic treatment conditions, such as tuberculosis, leprosy and other infections of joints, bones, etc.
A significant difference was observed in AUC(0-1) (4531.28 +/- 2147 vs 1629.1 +/- 1006 ng x h x ml(-1), p < 0.0001), AUC(0-infinity) (4632.42 +/- 2221.75 vs 1629.46 +/- 1012.61 ng x h x ml(-1), p = 0.0006), Cmax (544.89 +/- 273.91 vs 238.61 +/- 146.34 ng/ml, p = 0.04), t(1/2) (9.3 +/- 3.58 vs 4.0 +/- 1.43 h, p = 0.0317) and CL/F (43.14 +/- 36.23 vs 122.85 +/- 95 l x h(-1), p < 0.0001) of celecoxib administered before and after rifampicin pretreatment.
rifampicin pretreatment reduced the AUC of celecoxib by 64% and increased the clearance by 185%.
Effect of the novel anxiolytic drug deramciclane on cytochrome P(450) 2D6 activity as measured by desipramine pharmacokinetics.
In vitro findings have indicated that the novel anxiolytic drug, deramciclane, is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P(450) (CYP) 2D6 enzyme and co-administration of deramciclane and the CYP2D6 probe drug desipramine is possible in clinical practice.
To evaluate the effects of deramciclane on CYP2D6 activity as measured by desipramine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using paroxetine as a positive control for CYP2D6 inhibition.
Fifteen healthy subjects received either 60 mg deramciclane, 20 mg paroxetine or matched placebo for 8 days in randomized order in this double-blind, cross-over study.
On day 8 of each study phase, the subjects received a 100-mg single dose of desipramine.
Desipramine and its CYP2D6-dependent metabolite, 2-OH-desipramine, concentrations were measured for 240 h. Measurement of secretion of saliva, Visual Analogue Scale assessment of dryness of mouth and tiredness were carried out on day 7 and day 8 to assess the pharmacodynamic consequences of deramciclane or paroxetine co-administration with desipramine.
significant correlations were observed with paroxetine (r(s)=0.84, P<0.001) and deramciclane (r(s)=0.51, P=0.0498) concentrations and the magnitude of increase of desipramine AUC.
Both deramciclane and paroxetine decreased the formation of 2-OH-desipramine in the first-pass phase.
Although deramciclane seems to be a weaker inhibitor of CYP2D6 than paroxetine, dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be needed when used concomitantly with deramciclane.
Repeated administration of deramciclane doubled the AUC of desipramine ( P<0.001), while paroxetine caused a 4.8-fold increase in the AUC of desipramine ( P<0.001).
The AUC ratio of 2-OH-desipramine/desipramine was decreased by 39% ( P<0.001) by deramciclane and by 74% ( P<0.001) by paroxetine.
There were no changes in the secretion of saliva during co-administration of desipramine with deramciclane compared with placebo.
Nefazodone inhibits methylprednisolone disposition and enhances its adrenal-suppressant effect.
Nefazodone is a potent and selective inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), an enzyme pathway responsible for the biotransformation of a number of steroid compounds.
The potential therefore exists that nefazodone inhibits the disposition of methylprednisolone.
In this open label, repeated measures study, the effect of 9 days of nefazodone administration on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single 0.6 mg/kg intravenous dose of methylprednisolone was assessed.
Additionally the effect of concomitant nefazodone use on duration of cortisol suppression after methylprednisolone administration was assessed.
Eight healthy volunteers completed the study.
The duration of cortisol suppression after methylprednisolone administration was longer (> or =32 vs. 23.3 +/- 3.43 hours) during nefazodone administration.
Following nefazodone administration, the mean (+/-SD) area under the methylprednisolone concentration-time curve was significantly higher (1393 +/- 343 vs. 2966 +/- 928 ug*h/L; P < 0.005), apparent clearance was lower (28.7 +/- 7.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 7.8 L/h; P < 0.02) and the terminal elimination half-life was longer (2.28 +/- 0.49 vs. 3.32 +/- 0.95 hours; P < 0.02).
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of oral midazolam with ketoconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nefazodone.
The objective of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between midazolam and fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, and ketoconazole.
Forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive one of the four study drugs for 12 days in a parallel study design: fluoxetine 60 mg per day for 5 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 7 days; fluvoxamine titrated to a daily dose of 200 mg; nefazodone titrated to a daily dose of 400 mg; or ketoconazole 200 mg per day.
All 40 subjects received oral midazolam solution before and after the 12-day study drug regimen.
Blood samples for determination of midazolam concentrations were drawn for 24 hours after each midazolam dose and used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters.
The effects of the study drugs on midazolam pharmacodynamics were assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT).
Pharmacodynamic data are consistent with pharmacokinetic data indicating that nefazodone and ketoconazole resulted in significant increases in midazolam-related cognition impairment.
These results suggest that caution with the use of midazolam is warranted with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
The mean area under the curve (AUC) for midazolam was increased 771.9% by ketoconazole and 444.0% by nefazodone administration.
However, there was no significant change in midazolam AUC as a result of fluoxetine (13.4% decrease) and a statistical trend for fluvoxamine (66.1% increase) administration.
The significant impairment in subjects' cognitive function reflects the changes in midazolam clearance after treatment with ketoconazole and nefazodone.
Effect of mibefradil on CYP3A4 in vivo.
mibefradil, a calcium channel blocker, was removed from the market because of adverse drug interactions with coadministered CYP3A4 substrates.
This study examined the effect of mibefradil on the activity of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 in vivo, employing the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and oral midazolam pharmacokinetics.
This was a two-period, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which 8 male volunteers were randomized to the order of receiving placebo and a single 100-mg oral dose of mibefradil.
Oral midazolam was coadministered with intravenous [14C N-methyl] erythromycin 1 hour after mibefradil/placebo administration.
The EBT was performed 20 minutes following erythromycin administration.
Blood and urine were collected during the 36 hours following probe drug administration for analysis of midazolam pharmacokinetics.
mibefradil coadministration decreased the amount of exhaled 14CO2 in 6 of 8 subjects, with a mean decrease of 25%.
It was concluded that a single oral dose of mibefradil significantly inhibits CYP3A4 in intestine and liver.
These data support that adverse drug interactions involving mibefradil reflect inhibition of CYP3A4 in intestine and liver.
Also, they suggest that the EBT, while a valid probe of in vivo hepatic CYP3A4 activity, is a single time point measurement and may be less sensitive than oral midazolam pharmacokinetics in detecting CYP3A4 inhibition.
Coadministration of mibefradil increased the Cmax of midazolam 3-fold, the AUC 8- to 9-fold, and the t1/2 4-fold.
Effect of St John's wort on drug metabolism by induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.
St John's wort is a popular herbal product used to treat depression but it has been implicated in drug interactions.
To assess the potential of St John's wort administration to alter the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes extensively involved in drug metabolism.
Open-label crossover study with fixed treatment order conducted March 2002 to February 2003 in a US general clinical research center involving 12 healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women) aged 22 to 38 years before and after 14 days of administration of St John's wort.
Participants were given probe drugs (30 mg of dextromethorphan and 2 mg of alprazolam) to establish baseline CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6 activity.
After a minimum 7-day washout period, participants began taking one 300-mg tablet 3 times per day.
After 14 days of St John's wort administration, participants were given the probe drugs along with 1 St John's wort tablet to establish postadministration CYP activity; the St John's wort dosing regimen was continued for 48 hours.
Changes in plasma pharmacokinetics of alprazolam as a probe for CYP 3A4 activity and the ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite, dextrorphan, in urine as a probe for CYP 2D6 activity.
This suggests that long-term administration of St John's wort may result in diminished clinical effectiveness or increased dosage requirements for all CYP 3A4 substrates, which represent at least 50% of all marketed medications.
A 2-fold decrease in the area under the curve for alprazolam plasma concentration vs time (P<.001) and a 2-fold increase in alprazolam clearance (P<.001) were observed following St John's wort administration.
Alprazolam elimination half-life was shortened from a mean (SD) of 12.4 (3.9) hours to 6.0 (2.4) hours (P<.001).
The mean (SD) urinary ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite was 0.006 (0.010) at baseline and 0.014 (0.025) after St John's wort administration (P =.26).
A 14-day course of St John's wort administration significantly induced the activity of CYP 3A4 as measured by changes in alprazolam pharmacokinetics.
Effect of ketoconazole on venlafaxine plasma concentrations in extensive and poor metabolisers of debrisoquine.
To study the influence of CYP3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole on the disposition of venlafaxine in individuals with different CYP2D6 pheno- and genotypes.
In an open two-phase study, 21 healthy volunteers with known CYP2D6 pheno- and genotype [14 extensive metabolisers (EMs), 7 poor metabolisers (PMs)] were given a single oral dose of venlafaxine (50 mg to EMs and 25 mg to PMs).
Plasma and urine levels of venlafaxine and its three metabolites were measured and the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine were determined.
After a 2-week washout period, subjects were treated for 2 days with ketoconazole (100 mg twice daily) starting 1 day before the administration of venlafaxine; and the same parameters as for the administration of venlafaxine only were measured.
Data were evaluated from 20 subjects (14 EMs and 6 PMs) who completed the study.
The dose-corrected AUC of venlafaxine was on average 2.3 times higher ( P<0.01) and that of its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine 3.4 times lower ( P<0.0001) in PMs than EMs.
There was a good correlation between the debrisoquine metabolic ratio and the ratio between the AUC of venlafaxine and that of O-desmethylvenlafaxine ( Rs=0.93, P<0.002).
C(max) values increased by 32% and 18%, respectively.
The precise mechanisms underlying this interaction remain to be elucidated.
The majority of subjects showed higher plasma levels of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine upon co-administration of ketoconazole.
AUC of venlafaxine significantly increased by 36% and that of O-desmethylvenlafaxine by 26% ( P<0.01).
The elimination half-life of venlafaxine was unaltered.
Three of the PMs displayed marked increases in AUC (81, 126 and 206%) and C(max) (60, 72, 119%) of venlafaxine while the other three showed small or no changes.
Ketoconazole consistently affected the disposition of venlafaxine in EMs of debrisoquine while the response in PMs was erratic.
Effects of aprepitant on cytochrome P450 3A4 activity using midazolam as a probe.
Aprepitant is a neurokinin(1) receptor antagonist that enhances prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting when added to conventional therapy with a corticosteroid and a 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) antagonist.
Because aprepitant may be used with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and ancillary support drugs, which may be substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, assessment of the potential of this drug to inhibit CYP3A4 activity in vivo is important.
The effect of aprepitant on in vivo CYP3A4 activity in humans with oral midazolam used as a sensitive probe of CYP3A4 activity was evaluated in this study.
In this open-label, randomized, single-period study, 16 healthy male subjects were enrolled.
Subjects received one of two oral aprepitant regimens for 5 days (8 subjects per regimen): (1) 125 mg aprepitant on day 1 and then 80 mg/d on days 2 to 5 or (2) 40 mg aprepitant on day 1 and then 25 mg/d on days 2 to 5.
All subjects also received a single oral dose of midazolam, 2 mg, at prestudy (3 to 7 days before aprepitant treatment) and on days 1 and 5 (1 hour after aprepitant administration).
The 5-day 125/80-mg regimen of aprepitant produced moderateinhibition of CYP3A4 activity in humans, as measured with the use of midazolam as a probe drug.
Coadministration of midazolam and 125/80 mg aprepitant increased the midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 2.3-fold on day 1 (P <.01) and by 3.3-fold on day 5 (P <.01), as compared with midazolam alone (prestudy).
The 125/80-mg regimen of aprepitant also increased the midazolam maximum observed concentration by 1.5-fold on day 1 (P <.05) and by 1.9-fold on day 5 (P <.01).
The midazolam half-life values increased from 1.7 hours (prestudy) to 3.3 hours on both day 1 and day 5.
Coadministration of 40/25 mg aprepitant and midazolam did not result in significant changes in the midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum observed concentration, and half-life at either day 1 or day 5.
Interaction between ketoconazole and almotriptan in healthy volunteers.
The interaction between almotriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole was examined in 16 healthy volunteers.
Subjects received (A) 12.5 mg almotriptan orally on Day 2 of a 3-day regimen of 400 mg ketoconazole once daily and (B) 12.5 mg almotriptan in a crossover design.
Plasma and urine concentrations of almotriptan were measured by HPLC.
Treatment effects on almotriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed by analysis of variance.
These effects were statistically significant.
The effects of ketoconazole on almotriptan clearance were consistent with inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and a slight effect on the active tubular secretion of almotriptan.
Ketoconazole coadministration increased mean almotriptan AUC and Cmax from 312 to 490 ng h/mL and 52.6 to 84.5 ng/mL, respectively.
Mean oral clearance was decreased from 40.7 to 26.2 L/h by ketoconazole, with an accompanying increase in the fraction of almotriptan excreted unchanged in the urine (40.6% to 53.3%) and a decrease in renal clearance (16.4 to 13.8 L/h).
Effects of gemfibrozil, itraconazole, and their combination on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide: potentially hazardous interaction between gemfibrozil and repaglinide.
Our aim was to investigate possible interactions of gemfibrozil, itraconazole, and their combination with repaglinide.
In a randomised crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received twice daily for 3 days either 600 mg gemfibrozil, 100 mg itraconazole (first dose 200 mg), both gemfibrozil and itraconazole, or placebo.
On day 3 they ingested a 0.25 mg dose of repaglinide.
Plasma drug and blood glucose concentrations were followed for 7 h and serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations for 3 h postdose.
Clinicians should be aware of this previously unrecognised and potentially hazardous interaction between gemfibrozil and repaglinide.
Concomitant use of gemfibrozil and repaglinide is best avoided.
If the combination is considered necessary, repaglinide dosage should be greatly reduced and blood glucose concentrations carefully monitored.
Gemfibrozil raised the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of repaglinide 8.1-fold (range 5.5- to 15.0-fold; p<0.001) and prolonged its half-life (t(1/2)) from 1.3 to 3.7 h (p<0.001).
Although itraconazole alone raised repaglinide AUC only 1.4-fold (1.1- to 1.9-fold; p<0.001), the gemfibrozil-itraconazole combination raised it 19.4-fold (12.9- to 24.7-fold) and prolonged the t(1/2) of repaglinide to 6.1 h (p<0.001).
Plasma repaglinide concentration at 7 h was increased 28.6-fold by gemfibrozil and 70.4-fold by the gemfibrozil-itraconazole combination (p<0.001).
Gemfibrozil alone and in combination with itraconazole considerably enhanced and prolonged the blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide; i.e., repaglinide became a long-acting and stronger antidiabetic.
Duloxetine is both an inhibitor and a substrate of cytochrome P4502D6 in healthy volunteers.
Duloxetine, a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine currently undergoing clinical investigation for treatment of depression and stress urinary incontinence, has the potential to act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6).
Our objectives were to determine the effect of duloxetine on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant metabolized by CYP2D6 (study 1), and the effect of paroxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, on duloxetine pharmacokinetics (study 2).
Subjects were healthy men and women between 21 and 63 years old.
All subjects were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
In study 1, 50 mg of desipramine was administered as a single dose alone and in the presence of steady-state duloxetine 60 mg twice daily.
In study 2, steady-state pharmacokinetics of duloxetine 40 mg once daily were determined in the presence and absence of steady-state paroxetine 20 mg once daily.
Reports of adverse events were similar whether duloxetine was administered alone or in combination with desipramine or paroxetine.
Duloxetine 60 mg twice daily is a moderately potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, intermediate between paroxetine and sertraline.
The results of these 2 studies suggest that caution should be used when CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors are coadministered with duloxetine.
Duloxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of desipramine 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold.
Paroxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of duloxetine and the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state 1.6-fold.
The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine has a moderate effect on duloxetine concentrations.
Role of CYP2D6 in the stereoselective disposition of venlafaxine in humans.
CYP2D6 is involved in the O-demethylation metabolic pathway of venlafaxine in humans.
In this study, we investigated whether this isozyme is stereoselective.
Plasma samples from seven CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and five CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), collected during a period without and with coadministration of quinidine, were analysed.
Subjects were administered venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of quinidine sulphate every 12 h. Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h).
The present results show that, although CYP2D6 catalyses the O-demethylation of both enantiomers of venlafaxine, it displays a marked stereoselectivity towards the (R)-enantiomer.
The oral clearance of (R)-venlafaxine was found to be nine-fold higher in EMs compared to PMs [median (range) 173 (29-611) l/h versus 20 (16-24) l/h, P < 0.005], while it was two-fold higher for (S)-venlafaxine [73 (32-130) l/h versus 37 (21-44) l/h, P < 0.05].
In contrast, data obtained on the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to N-demethylated metabolites, a reaction which is mediated by CYP3A4, suggest a lack of stereoselectivity of this enzyme.
In EMs, quinidine decreased (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine oral clearance by 12-fold ( 0.05) and four-fold ( 0.05), respectively.
In contrast, quinidine did not have any effects on renal clearance of (R)-venlafaxine [4 (2-10) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 5 (0.6-7) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine] and of (S)-venlafaxine [4 (1-7) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 3 (0.4-6) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine].
The coadministration of quinidine to EMs resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the partial metabolic clearance of (R)-venlafaxine to O-demethylated metabolites [127 (10-493) l/h down to 1 (0.1-3) l/h, 0.05], while a seven-fold reduction was measured for (S)-venlafaxine [47 (14-94) l/h versus 7 (1-19) l/h, 0.05].
In PMs, coadministration of quinidine did not significantly change oral clearance and partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to its various metabolites.
The cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor itraconazole markedly increases the plasma concentrations of dexamethasone and enhances its adrenal-suppressant effect.
To examine the possible interaction of itraconazole with orally and intravenously administered dexamethasone.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with four phases, eight healthy subjects took either 200 mg itraconazole (in two phases) or placebo (in two phases) orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4 each subject received an oral dose of 4.5 mg dexamethasone or an intravenous dose of 5.0 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate during both itraconazole and placebo phases.
Plasma dexamethasone and cortisol concentrations were determined by HPLC up to 71 hours, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole up to 23 hours.
Itraconazole decreased the systemic clearance of intravenously administered dexamethasone by 68% (P < .001), increased the total area under the plasma dexamethasone concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 3.3-fold (P < .001), and prolonged the elimination half-life of dexamethasone 3.2-fold (P < .001).
The AUC(0-infinity) of oral dexamethasone was increased 3.7-fold (P < .001), the peak plasma concentration 1.7-fold (P < .001), and the elimination half-life 2.8-fold (P < .001) by itraconazole.
The morning plasma cortisol concentrations measured 47 and 71 hours after administration of dexamethasone were substantially lower after exposure to itraconazole than to placebo (P < .001).
Accordingly, the adrenal-suppressant effect of dexamethasone was greatly enhanced during the itraconazole phases.
Itraconazole markedly increases the systemic exposure to and effects of dexamethasone.
A careful follow-up is recommended when itraconazole or other potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 are added to the drug regimen of patients receiving dexamethasone.
Effect of rifampin on plasma concentrations of mefloquine in healthy volunteers.
Mefloquine is a 4-quinolinemethanol compound structurally related to quinine.
Quinine is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme (CYP3A4), whereas rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, is known to markedly decrease plasma quinine concentration.
Our aim was to study the effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine, and explore a possible role of CYP3A4 on mefloquine metabolism.
In an open, two-phase crossover study, seven healthy Thai male volunteers received a single oral dose of 500 mg mefloquine alone, or 500 mg mefloquine plus a long-term administration of 600 mg rifampin.
Blood samples were collected at specific time points over a 56-day period.
Plasma mefloquine and its carboxylic acid metabolite were measured by HPLC for pharmacokinetic analysis.
The AUC0 - infinity and CL of the mefloquine metabolite were increased by 30% and 25%, respectively, but were not significantly different from the control phase.
The CYP3A4 isozyme most likely plays an important role in the enhanced metabolism of mefloquine.
Simultaneous use of rifampin and mefloquine should be avoided to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of mefloquine and prevent the risk of Plasmodium falciparum resistance in malarial treatment.
The results indicate that rifampin significantly decreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0 - infinity) of mefloquine by 68% (P < 0.01), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by 19% (P < 0.001), and elimination half-life (t1/2) by 63% (P < 0.01), whereas the time to reach Cmax (t(max)) of mefloquine was unaffected.
The apparent oral clearance (CL) of mefloquine was significantly increased by 281% (P < 0.01).
After administration of rifampin, the Cmax of the carboxylic acid metabolite of mefloquine was significantly increased by 47% (P < 0.05), whereas the t1/2 was significantly decreased by 39% (P < 0.01), and t(max) by 76% (P < 0.01).
The results indicate that rifampin reduces the plasma concentration of a single oral dose of 500 mg mefloquine by increasing metabolism of mefloquine in the liver and gut wall.
Itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin to a greater extent than either cerivastatin or pravastatin.
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are metabolized by distinct pathways that may alter the extent of drug-drug interactions.
Cerivastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP2C8.
Atorvastatin is metabolized solely by CYP3A4, and pravastatin metabolism is not well defined.
Coadministration of higher doses of these statins with CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential for eliciting adverse drug-drug interactions.
To determine the comparative effect of itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin.
In this single-site, randomized, three-way crossover, open-labeled study, healthy subjects (n = 18) received single doses of cerivastatin 0.8 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg without and with itraconazole 200 mg.
Pharmacokinetic parameters [AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-tn), peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2)] were determined for parent statins and major metabolites.
The elevation in atorvastatin AUC was significantly greater than that of cerivastatin (P < .005) or pravastatin (P < .005).
Concomitant cerivastatin/itraconazole treatment produced small elevations in the cerivastatin AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, and t1/2 (27%, 25%, and 19%, respectively; P < .05 versus cerivastatin alone).
Itraconazole coadministration produced similar changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics [AUC elevated 51% (P < .05 versus pravastatin alone), 24% (Cmax), and 23% (t1/2), respectively].
However, itraconazole dramatically increased atorvastatin AUC (150%), Cmax (38%), and t1/2 (30%) (P < .05).
Itraconazole markedly elevated atorvastatin plasma levels (2.5-fold) after 20 mg dosing, suggesting that concomitant itraconazole/atorvastatin therapy be carefully considered.
Itraconazole produced modest elevations in the plasma levels of cerivastatin 0.8 mg or pravastatin 40 mg (1.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively), indicating that combination treatment with itraconazole with cerivastatin or pravastatin may be preferable.
The effect of erythromycin, fluvoxamine, and their combination on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine.
We studied the effect of fluvoxamine and erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine in a double-blinded, randomized, four-way cross-over study.
Eight healthy volunteers ingested daily 1500 mg erythromycin for 6 days, 100 mg fluvoxamine for 5 days (Days 2-6), both erythromycin and fluvoxamine, or placebo.
On Day 6, each subject received a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg ropivacaine IV over 30 min.
Ropivacaine, 3-hydroxyropivacaine, and 2',6'-pipecoloxylidide in venous plasma and urine samples were measured for up to 12 h and 24 h, respectively.
Implications: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of increased toxicity of ropivacaine when used together with inhibitors of CYP1A2.
Concomitant use of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inhibitors further increases ropivacaine concentration.
Fluvoxamine increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ropivacaine 3.7-fold (P: < 0.001), prolonged the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 2.3 to 7.4 h (P: < 0.01), and decreased the clearance by 77% (P: < 0.001).
Erythromycin alone had only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine.
However, when compared with fluvoxamine alone, the combination of fluvoxamine and erythromycin further increased the area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve and t(1/2) of ropivacaine by 50% (P: < 0.01).
We conclude that inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine considerably reduces elimination of ropivacaine.
Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin further increases plasma ropivacaine concentration by decreasing its clearance.
Plasma concentrations of active simvastatin acid are increased by gemfibrozil.
Concomitant treatment with simvastatin and gemfibrozil, two lipid-lowering drugs, has been associated with occurrence of myopathy in case reports.
The aim of this study was to determine whether gemfibrozil affects the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and whether it affects CYP3A4 activity in vitro.
A double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases (placebo and gemfibrozil) was carried out.
Ten healthy volunteers were given gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily) or placebo orally for 3 days.
On day 3 they ingested a single 40-mg dose of simvastatin.
Plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured up to 12 hours.
In addition, the effect of gemfibrozil (0 to 1,200 micromol/L) on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, a CYP3A4 model reaction, was investigated in human liver microsomes in vitro.
In vitro, gemfibrozil showed no inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation.
Gemfibrozil increases plasma concentrations of simvastatin and, in particular, its active form, simvastatin acid, suggesting that the increased risk of myopathy in combination treatment is, at least partially, of a pharmacokinetic origin.
Because gemfibrozil does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, the mechanism of the pharmacokinetic interaction is probably inhibition of non-CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of simvastatin acid.
Gemfibrozil increased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of simvastatin [AUC(0-infinity)] by 35% (P < .01) and the AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin acid by 185% (P < .001).
The elimination half-life of simvastatin was increased by 74% (P < .05), and that of simvastatin acid was increased by 51% (P < .01) by gemfibrozil.
The peak concentration of simvastatin acid was increased by 112%, from 3.20 +/- 2.73 ng/mL to 6.78 +/- 4.67 ng/mL (mean +/- SD; P < .01).
Effect of fluconazole on plasma fluvastatin and pravastatin concentrations.
To study the effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin and pravastatin, two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.
Two separate randomised, double-blind, two-phase, crossover studies with identical study design were carried out.
In each study, 12 healthy volunteers were given a 4-day pretreatment with oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo, according to a randomisation schedule.
On day 4, a single oral dose of 40 mg fluvastatin (study I) or 40 mg pravastatin (study II) was administered orally.
Plasma concentrations of fluvastatin, pravastatin and fluconazole were measured over 24 h. "
Care should be taken if fluconazole or other potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 are prescribed to patients using fluvastatin.
However, pravastatin is not susceptible to interactions with fluconazole or other potent CYP2C9 inhibitors.
In study 1, fluconazole increased the mean area under the plasma fluvastatin concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) by 84% (P < 0.01), the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of fluvastatin by 80% (P < 0.01) and its mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 44% (P < 0.05).
In study II, fluconazole had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin.
Fluconazole has a significant interaction with fluvastatin.
The mechanism of the increased plasma concentrations and prolonged elimination of fluvastatin is probably inhibition of the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of fluvastatin by fluconazole.
Pharmacokinetic interactions between sildenafil and saquinavir/ritonavir.
To investigate the effect of the antiretroviral protease inhibitors saquinavir (soft gelatin capsule) and ritonavir on the pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability of sildenafil and to investigate the effect of sildenafil on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir and ritonavir.
Two independent, 8 day, open, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (containing a double-blind crossover phase) were conducted at Pfizer Clinical research units (Canterbury, UK.
and Brussels, Belgium).
Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers entered each study.
In each study, volunteers were randomized (n = 14 per group) to receive sildenafil on day 1 followed by a 7-day treatment period (days 2-8) with saquinavir or placebo (Study I) or ritonavir or placebo (Study II).
Sildenafil or placebo (Study I and Study II) was administered alternately on day 7 or day 8, depending on initial randomization.
The effect of saquinavir and ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil and its primary circulating metabolite (UK-103, 320) and the effect of single-dose sildenafil on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) were determined.
The safety and tolerability of sildenafil coadministered with saquinavir or ritonavir were also assessed.
This compared with increases of 3.1-fold (95% CI: 2.5, 4.0) and 2.4-fold (95% CI: 1.8, 3.3) for coadministration with saquinavir.
The increases in systemic exposure to sildenafil and UK-103, 320 were not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events or clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate or ECG parameters.
The more pronounced effect of ritonavir may be attributed to its additional potent inhibition of CYP2C9.
No change in safety or tolerability was observed when sildenafil was coadministered with either protease inhibitor.
However, given the extent of the interactions, a lower sildenafil starting dose (25 mg) should be considered for patients receiving saquinavir and it is recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg in a 48 h period for patients receiving ritonavir.
Both protease inhibitors significantly increased Cmax, AUC, tmax and t(1/2) values for both sildenafil and UK-103, 320.
Ritonavir showed a significantly greater effect than saquinavir with increases in sildenafil AUC and Cmax of 11-fold (95% CI: 9.0, 12.0) and 3.9-fold (95% CI: 3.2, 4.9), respectively.
In contrast, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir and ritonavir were unaffected by sildenafil.
These results indicate that both saquinavir and ritonavir modify the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil presumably through inhibition of CYP3A4.
The effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral prednisolone.
To examine the possible effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered prednisolone.
In this double-blind, randomised, two-phase cross-over study, ten healthy subjects received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, 20 mg prednisolone was given orally.
Plasma concentrations of prednisolone, cortisol, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined by means of high-performance liquid chromatography up to 47 h. "
The susceptibility of prednisolone to interact with CYP3A4 inhibitors is considerably smaller than that of methylprednisolone, and itraconazole and probably also other inhibitors of CYP3A4 can be used concomitantly with prednisolone without marked changes in the effects of this corticosteroid.
Itraconazole increased the total area under the plasma prednisolone concentration-time curve by 24% (P < 0.001) and the elimination half-life of prednisolone by 29% (P < 0.001) compared with placebo.
The peak plasma concentration and time to the peak of prednisolone were not affected by itraconazole.
The mean morning plasma cortisol concentration, measured 23 h after the ingestion of prednisolone, during the itraconazole phase was 73% of that during the placebo phase (P < 0.001).
The observed minor interaction between itraconazole and oral prednisolone is probably of limited clinical significance.
Influence of hydroxychloroquine on the bioavailability of oral metoprolol.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Since there is great interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of HCQ and chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6-catalysed pathways in vitro, we wished to study the interaction of HCQ with CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of other drugs in vivo.
Metoprolol and dextromethorphan (DM) were selected as probe drugs because they are well-studied and widely used test substrates of CYP2D6.
In this randomized, double-blind crossover study, seven healthy volunteers with extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6 ingested either 400 mg hydroxychloroquine or placebo daily for 8 days after which single oral dose pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were investigated.
Dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DM-MR) was also determined at baseline and after the ingestion of HCQ or placebo.
While the DM-MR values were not significantly changed, the phenotypic classification of one individual, who was heterozygous for a mutant CYP2D6 allele, was converted to a poor metabolizer by HCQ administration.
Concomitant administration of HCQ increased the bioavailability of metoprolol, as indicated by significant increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (65 +/- 4.6%) and maximal plasma concentrations (72 +/- 6.9%) of metoprolol.
HCQ inhibits metoprolol metabolism most probably by inhibiting its biotransformation by CYP2D6.
The inhibitory effect of HCQ on dextromethorphan metabolism was not apparent when DM-MR was used as an indicator, except in an individual with limited CYP2D6 capacity.
Influence of CYP2D6 activity on the disposition and cardiovascular toxicity of the antidepressant agent venlafaxine in humans.
According to in-vitro studies with microsomes from human livers and from yeast expression systems with high CYP2D6 activity, the major oxidation pathway of venlafaxine is catalysed by CYP2D6.
In this study, we investigated the role of the CYP2D6 polymorphism and the effects of low-dose quinidine, a selective inhibitor of, CYP2D6, on the disposition of venlafaxine.
Fourteen healthy men, eight with the extensive metabolizer and six with the poor metabolizer phenotype were administered venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of quinidine sulfate 100 mg every 12 h. Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h).
When venlafaxine was administered alone, the oral clearance of venlafaxine was more than fourfold less in poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers (P < 0.05).
This was mainly due to a decreased capability of poor metabolizers to form O-desmethylated metabolites at the position 4 of the aromatic moiety.
decreased CYP2D6 activity could also be associated with cardiovascular toxicity as observed in four patients during treatment with the drug.
Thus, genetically determined or pharmacologically altered CYP2D6 activity represents a major determinant of venlafaxine disposition in humans.
In extensive metabolizers, quinidine decreased venlafaxine oral clearance from 100 +/- 62 l/h to 17 +/- 5 l/h (mean +/- SD; P < 0.05) without any effects on renal clearance (4 +/- 1 l/h during venlafaxine alone and 4 +/- 1 l/h during venlafaxine plus quinidine).
In these individuals, the sequential metabolism of venlafaxine to O-desmethylvenlafaxine and to N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine was inhibited by quinidine coadministration so that metabolic clearances to O-desmethylated metabolites decreased from 43 +/- 32 l/h to 2 +/- 1 l/h (P < 0.05).
In poor metabolizers, coadministration of quinidine did not cause significant changes in oral clearance and partial metabolic clearances of venlafaxine to its various metabolites.
The effects of ketoconazole on ziprasidone pharmacokinetics--a placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers.
To assess the effects of multiple oral doses of ketoconazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral ziprasidone HCl.
This was a 14-day, open-label, randomized, crossover study in 14 healthy subjects aged 18-31 years.
Group 1 received oral ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 6 days, followed by a 2 day wash-out period and 6 days of placebo administration.
Group 2 received placebo followed by ketoconazole.
Single oral doses of ziprasidone HCl 40 mg were administered on days 5 and 13 in both groups.
Ziprasidone pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo and ketoconazole administration periods.
Mean Cmax increased by 34%, from 89 ng ml(-1) to 119 ng ml(-1), respectively.
The treatment effect on both of these parameters was statistically significant (P<0.02).
Most adverse events were of mild intensity.
There were no serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, abnormal ECGs, or clinically significant alterations in vital signs throughout the study.
This suggests that other inhibitors of CYP3A4 are unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone.
Co-administration of ziprasidone with ketoconazole was associated with a modest increase in ziprasidone exposure; mean ziprasidone AUC(0,infinity) increased by 33%, from 899 ng ml(-1) h with placebo to 1199 ng ml(-1) h with ketoconazole.
The concurrent administration of ketoconazole and ziprasidone led to modest, statistically significant increases in ziprasidone exposure, although the changes seen were not considered clinically relevant.
Effect of omeprazole on the metabolism of cilostazol.
In vitro results suggest that cilostazol is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 1A2, 2D6, 3A4 and 2C19.
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of omeprazole (a CYP2C19 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100 mg oral dose of cilostazol.
This study was conducted as a single-centre, open-label, nonrandomised, 2-period, crossover pharmacokinetic trial.
A single 100 mg dose of cilostazol was administered orally on days 0 and 14.
Oral omeprazole (40 mg every day) was administered on days 7 to 18.
20 healthy nonsmoking male and female volunteers.
Serial blood samples were collected before and after cilostazol administration to characterise the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its metabolites.
For the 2 major circulating metabolites, OPC-13015 and OPC-13213, the OPC-13015 Cmax and AUCt increased by 29 and 69%, respectively (p < 0.001).
However, for OPC-13213, the Cmax and AUCt decreased by 22 and 31%, respectively (p < 0.001).
The plasma protein binding of cilostazol was unaffected by coadministration of omeprazole.
For the other active metabolite, OPC-13213, systemic exposure decreased by 31% because of inhibition of cilostazol metabolism to this metabolite.
These changes in systemic exposure were well tolerated.
A dose of 50 mg cilostazol twice a day should be considered during coadministration of inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as omeprazole.
Following omeprazole coadministration, the increases in cilostazol maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at time t (AUCt) were 18% (p = 0.062) and 26% (p < 0.001), respectively.
Coadministration of cilostazol with omeprazole resulted in an increase in the systemic exposure of cilostazol and its active metabolite, OPC-13015, by 26 and 69%, respectively.
Indinavir concentrations and St John's wort.
St John's wort reduced the area under the curve of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir by a mean of 57% (SD 19) and decreased the extrapolated 8-h indinavir trough by 81% (16) in healthy volunteers.
A reduction in indinavir exposure of this magnitude could lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure.
Simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity in vivo with alprazolam and caffeine.
Alprazolam (ALP) and caffeine (CAF) were suggested as probe drugs for the activities of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, respectively.
We investigated the disposition of oral ALP (1 mg) and CAF (100 mg) in 17 normal volunteers to establish and validate a procedure for the simultaneous assessment of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzyme activity.
Nine received ALP alone, ALP and CAF and CAF alone in an open three-way crossover study to test for pharmacokinetic interaction.
Four received ALP after a 2-day pretreatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and four normal volunteers received ALP after 4 days of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4.
AUC values of ALP and CAF administered alone were not different from AUC values when both drugs were administered combined, indicating that there is no metabolic interaction.
The ratio formed of paraxanthine and CAF correlated significantly with systemic CAF clearance at 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h. There was a strong correlation between AUC values of ALP and CAF and the plasma concentration obtained 6, 8, 10, or 24 h after ingestion of the drug.
We conclude that ALP and CAF can be administered simultaneously for the assessment of CYP activity.
Plasma concentrations 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after drug ingestion reflect AUC of ALP and CAF and therefore in-vivo CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 activity, respectively.
Ketoconazole and rifampin pretreatment significantly changed AUC values of ALP (mean AUC values in microg/l h: ALP = 242.2, ALP + ketoconazole = 426.2, ALP + rifampin = 28.4, ANOVA F = 17.7, P < 0.001).
mibefradil but not isradipine substantially elevates the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam.
The calcium channel blockers mibefradil and isradipine inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro.
However, their in vivo inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 are not known in detail, although mibefradil was recently withdrawn from the market because of serious drug interactions.
The effects of mibefradil and isradipine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral triazolam, a model substrate of CYP3A4, were studied in a randomized, double-blind crossover study with three phases.
Nine healthy subjects took 50 mg mibefradil, 5 mg isradipine, or placebo orally once a day for 3 days.
On day 3, each subject received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam.
Thereafter, blood samples were collected up to 18 hours, and pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam were measured up to 8 hours.
mibefradil increased the total area under the plasma triazolam concentration-time curve [AUC(0 - infinity)] 9-fold compared with placebo (P < .001).
The peak plasma concentration of triazolam was increased 1.8-fold (3.4+/-0.1 ng/mL versus 1.8+/-0.2 ng/mL [mean +/- SEM]; P < .001), and the elimination half-life (t 1/2) was increased 4.9-fold (18.5+/-1.9 hours versus 4.0+/-0.5 hours; P < .001) by mibefradil.
In addition, mibefradil was associated with increased pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam.
In contrast to mibefradil, isradipine reduced the AUC(0 - infinity) and t 1/2 of triazolam by about 20% (P < .05) and had no significant effects on the pharmacodynamics of triazolam.
mibefradil but not isradipine markedly increases the plasma concentrations of triazolam and thereby enhances and prolongs its pharmacodynamic effects, consistent with potent inhibition of CYP3A4.
Ketoconazole inhibits the clearance of the enantiomers of the antidepressant reboxetine in humans.
Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.
Reboxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.
The potential interaction of reboxetine with this representative from the azole derivative class was examined.
Eleven healthy volunteers received (1) 4 mg reboxetine orally on the second day of a 5-day regimen of 200 mg ketoconazole once daily and (2) 4 mg reboxetine orally in a crossover design.
Plasma concentrations of reboxetine enantiomers [R,R(-)-reboxetine and the more active S,S(+)-reboxetine] were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Effects of ketoconazole on enantiomer pharmacokinetics were assessed by ANOVA.
Ketoconazole did not significantly affect maximal plasma concentrations (P > .1).
Although the adverse effect profile for reboxetine was not altered by ketoconazole, the results of this study suggest that caution should be used and that a reduction in reboxetine dose should be considered when the two are coadministered.
Ketoconazole increased R,R(-)-reboxetine and S,S(+)-reboxetine mean area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) by 58% and 43%, respectively (P < .02).
Oral clearance of both enantiomers was consequently decreased 34% and 24%, respectively, by ketoconazole (P < .005).
Mean terminal half-life after administration of ketoconazole (21.5 hours and 18.9 hours) was significantly longer than after reboxetine alone (14.8 hours and 14.4 hours; P < or = .005).
The AUC ratio for R,R(-)-reboxetine to S,S(+)-reboxetine was reduced by ketoconazole administration (2.76 after ketoconazole versus 2.39; P < .003).
Ketoconazole decreases clearance of both reboxetine enantiomers.
Grapefruit juice has minimal effects on plasma concentrations of lovastatin-derived 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.
To evaluate the effect of regular-strength grapefruit juice, a cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of a commonly prescribed regimen of oral lovastatin.
In a randomized crossover study, 16 healthy subjects received a single 40 mg dose of lovastatin in the evening after each consumed an 8-ounce glass of regular-strength grapefruit juice or water with breakfast for 3 consecutive days.
The effect of the same grapefruit juice and water regimen on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (2 mg oral dose given 1 hour after the third day of grapefruit juice and water) was used as a positive control in the same subjects.
Plasma concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, and concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, and midazolam were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Similar effects on AUC and Cmax (approximately 40% increase for each) were noted after analysis of samples of hydrolyzed plasma (which converts inactive lactones to active hydroxy acid species).
Daily consumption of a glass of regular-strength grapefruit juice has a minimal effect on plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (approximately 30% to 40% increase) after a 40 mg evening dose of lovastatin.
The area under the plasma concentration-time profiles (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increased slightly (-30% for each) after consumption of grapefruit juice.
The AUC and Cmax values for lovastatin approximately doubled in the presence of grapefruit juice, whereas the same parameters for lovastatin acid increased 1.6-fold.
Grapefruit juice caused the AUC for midazolam to increase by a factor of approximately 2.4.
Interaction of sildenafil and indinavir when co-administered to HIV-positive patients.
The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in HIV-infected men is estimated to be 33%.
Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, Kent, UK) is the first oral drug for this condition.
Since sildenafil and the protease inhibitors are both metabolized by, and act as inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of the combination sildenafil plus indinavir in HIV-infected patients.
Six patients at steady state in treatment with indinavir participated in the study.
On the first day blood samples for indinavir assay were drawn at times 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h after dosing.
On the second study day patients received a single dose of 25 mg of sildenafil in addition to their routine morning medication.
Blood samples were taken as described.
Separated plasma was stored at -80 degrees C until analysis by high performance liquid chromatography.
In a parallel study, the effect of indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and nelfinavir on the in vitro hepatic metabolism of sildenafil was assessed.
The geometric mean area under the concentration curve for 0-8 h (AUC0-8h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for indinavir were 19.69 microg/ml h (range, 9.19-31.99 microg/ml h) and 7.02 microg/ml (range, 2.33-16.17 microg/ml), respectively, on the first study day.
The geometric mean AUC0-8h and Cmax for sildenafil were 1631 ng/ml h (range, 643-2970 ng/ml h) and 384 ng/ml (range, 209-766 ng/ml) respectively.
The AUC for sildenafil was 4.4 times higher than data from historical controls given either 50 mg or 100 mg of sildenafil and dose normalized to 25 mg.
Indinavir was a potent inhibitor of sildenafil hepatic metabolism in vitro [concentration producing 50% inhibition of control enzyme activity (IC50) = 0.39 +/- 0.17 microM, mean +/- SD].
The magnitude of this interaction suggests a lower starting dose of sildenafil may be more appropriate in this clinical setting.
In the presence of sildenafil, the mean AUC0-8h and Cmax of indinavir were 22.37 microg/ml h [range, 10.08-37.25 microg/ml h; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference between means, -15 to 13.25) and 9.11 microg/ml (range, 3.41-22.78 microg/ml; 95% CI, -13 to 6.37), respectively.
Co-administration of sildenafil 25 mg did not significantly alter the plasma indinavir levels.
However, plasma sildenafil AUC was markedly increased in the presence of indinavir compared with historical controls.
From the in vitro data, the mechanism of increase is indinavir inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of sildenafil.
altered pharmacokinetics of indinavir by a novel nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (HBY-097): a pharmacokinetic evaluation in HIV-positive patients.
HBY-097 (HBY), an investigational nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and indinavir (IDV) share a common metabolic pathway, cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4), and may clinically be used together as well as with zidovudine (ZDV).
Thus, the potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between these drugs was evaluated.
HBY (500 mg Q8H), IDV (800 mg Q8H), and ZDV (200 mg Q8H) were given to 8 HIV-infected subjects.
Serial plasma samples were collected at baseline (ZDV and IDV alone) and day 11 (all 3 drugs) to determine PK parameters using noncompartmental analysis.
PK parameters for ZDV in the presence and absence of HBY were not appreciably different.
The increase in IDV CL/F is consistent with the observed metabolic induction effects of other NNRTIs.
However, both the maximum (Cmax) and minimum (Cmin) concentrations of IDV were significantly reduced, from a mean of 7514 +/- 1636 and 146 +/- 81 mcg/L to 4725 +/- 2494 mcg/L and 54 +/- 24 mcg/L (p < .05) after addition of HBY.
Furthermore, apparent clearance (CL/F) of IDV before and after 11 days of concomitant HBY administration was significantly higher, from 0.69 +/- 0.14 to 1.94 +/- 0.63 L/h/kg (p < .05) with an associated reduction in area under the curve (AUC0-8) from 16,034 +/- 4903 to 6134 +/- 2701 mg/L/h (p < .05).
The results of this trial showed that HBY significantly alters the pharmacokinetic parameters of IDV at the dose studied.
Effects of clarithromycin on the metabolism of omeprazole in relation to CYP2C19 genotype status in humans.
A triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin (INN, amoxicilline), and clarithromycin is widely used for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
Omeprazole and clarithromycin are metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
This study aimed to elucidate whether clarithromycin affects the metabolism of omeprazole.
After administration of placebo or 400 mg clarithromycin twice a day for 3 days, 20 mg omeprazole and placebo or 400 mg clarithromycin were administered to 21 healthy volunteers.
Plasma concentrations of omeprazole and clarithromycin and their metabolites were determined before and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 24 hours after dosing.
CYP2C19 genotype status was determined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
Subjects were classified into three groups on the basis of PCR-RFLP analyses for CYP2C19: homozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 6), heterozygous extensive metabolizer group (n = 11), and poor metabolizer group (n = 4).
There were significant differences in the mean AUC values of clarithromycin among the three groups.
Drug interaction between clarithromycin and omeprazole may underlie high eradication rates achieved by triple therapy with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.
Mean area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 hours (AUC) of omeprazole in the homozygous extensive metabolizer, heterozygous extensive metabolizer, and poor metabolizer groups were significantly increased by clarithromycin from 383.9 to 813.1, from 1001.9 to 2110.4, and from 5589.7 to 13098.6 ng x h/mL, respectively.
Clarithromycin inhibits the metabolism of omeprazole.
Duration of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) inhibition and estimation of functional CYP2E1 enzyme half-life after single-dose disulfiram administration in humans.
Disulfiram (DSF) is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1), resulting in loss of CYP2E1 protein and activity, which may be useful in preventing CYP2E1-mediated xenobiotic toxicity.
The duration of inhibition after a single DSF dose is, however, unknown.
The purpose of this investigation was to determine this duration, and CYP2E1 formation and degradation rates, in humans.
Oral chlorzoxazone (CLZ) was used as the selective in vivo probe for CYP2E1.
Healthy subjects received CLZ to determine baseline CYP2E1 activity (CLZ plasma clearance and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone fractional metabolic clearance).
One week later, DSF (500 mg orally) was administered at bedtime, and CLZ administered the following morning and 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days after DSF.
A terminal DSF metabolite, 2-thiothiazolidine-4 carboxylic acid, was also measured in each 24-h urine sample.
The mean CLZ clearance and 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone fractional metabolic clearance on the first day declined to 10.2 and 5.5% of baseline values, indicating rapid and profound CYP2E1 inhibition.
CYP2E1 activity returned to half that of control on day 3, and to baseline values on day 8.
Assuming zero-order synthesis and first-order degradation, the in vivo CYP2E1 synthesis rate and degradation half-life was estimated to be 11 +/- 5 nmol/h and 50 +/- 19 h, respectively.
significant amounts of 2-thiothiazolidine-4 carboxylic acid were present only on day 1, suggesting that the return of in vivo CYP2E1 activity was not caused by inhibitor washout, but by enzyme resynthesis.
Results regarding CYP2E1 disposition may be useful for modeling the effects of CYP2E1 inducers and inhibitors.
For prevention of CYP2E1-mediated bioactivation, depending on protoxicant disposition, a second DSF dose might be necessary to completely prevent toxicity.
Ritonavir's role in reducing fentanyl clearance and prolonging its half-life.
The human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, and ritonavir's concomitant administration with the substrates of this enzyme may lead to dangerous drug interactions.
The authors investigated possible interactions between ritonavir and intravenously administered fentanyl in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in two phases.
Twelve healthy volunteers received orally ritonavir or placebo for 3 days; the dose of ritonavir was 200 mg three times on the first day and 300 mg three times on the second.
The last dose of ritonavir 300 mg or placebo was given on the morning of the third day.
On the second day, 2 h after the afternoon pretreatment dose, fentanyl 5 microg/kg was injected intravenously in 2 min with naloxone to moderate its effects, and 15 timed venous blood samples were collected for 18 h. "
One subject discontinued participation before fentanyl administration because of severe side effects, and during the study 8 of the remaining 11 subjects reported nausea.
Ritonavir reduced the clearance of fentanyl by 67% from 15.6+/-8.2 to 5.2+/-2.0 ml x min(-1) x kg(-1) (P<0.01).
The area under the fentanyl plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 18 h was increased from 4.8+/-2.7 to 8.8+/-2.3 ng x ml(-1) x h(-1) by ritonavir (P<0.01).
Ritonavir did not affect the initial concentrations and the steady-state volume of distribution of fentanyl.
Ritonavir can inhibit the metabolism of fentanyl significantly, so caution should be exercised if fentanyl is given to patients receiving ritonavir medication.
Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of tacrine metabolism in vivo.
In vitro studies have shown that tacrine is metabolized by cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2).
One of the monohydroxy-metabolites has been incriminated with tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity.
The aim of this study was to establish whether the potent CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine in clinically relevant doses could inhibit tacrine metabolism.
Eighteen healthy young men were enrolled in an open, randomized crossover study.
In the first study period a single oral dose of tacrine 40 mg was given.
In the second period the volunteers were randomized to maintenance doses of fluvoxamine 50 or 100 mg per day, and a single oral dose of tacrine 20 mg was given.
Fluvoxamine was found to be a very potent inhibitor of tacrine metabolism.
The medians of the steady-state concentration of fluvoxamine were 43 nM (range 25-49) and 70 nM (range 44-124) in the 50 mg per day and 100 mg per day groups, respectively.
The steady-state concentration of fluvoxamine correlated with the fractional decrement in tacrine clearance (Spearman Rs = 0.53, P < 0.05).
This interaction is very likely to have clinical relevance.
Whether concomitant fluvoxamine treatment reduces tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity needs further study.
A fractional decrement in tacrine clearance of approximately 85% was found with both fluvoxamine doses, which was in good agreement with a prediction based on in vitro data.
modest, but statistically significant, reductions in the formation of the metabolites 1- and 2-hydroxytacrine were found during concomitant fluvoxamine treatment.
Fluvoxamine at clinically relevant doses is a potent inhibitor of tacrine metabolism.
Itraconazole decreases the clearance and enhances the effects of intravenously administered methylprednisolone in healthy volunteers.
A possible interaction of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with intravenously administered methylprednisolone, was examined.
In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase cross-over study, 9 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or matched placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, a dose of 16 mg methylprednisolone as sodium succinate was administered intravenously.
Plasma concentrations of methylprednisolone, cortisol, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined up to 24 hr.
The volume of distribution of methylprednisolone was not affected by itraconazole.
Care should be taken when itraconazole or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are used concomitantly with methylprednisolone.
Itraconazole increased the total area under the plasma methylprednisolone concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity) 2.6-fold) (P<0.001), while the AUC (12-24) of methylprednisolone was increased 12.2-fold (P<0.001).
The systemic clearance of methylprednisolone during the itraconazole phase was 40% of that during the placebo phase (P<0.01).
The mean elimination half-life of methylprednisolone was increased from 2.1+/-0.3 hr to 4.8+/-0.8 hr (P<0.001) by itraconazole.
The mean morning plasma cortisol concentration during the itraconazole phase, measured 24 hr after the administration of methylprednisolone, was only about 9% of that during the placebo phase (11.0+/-9.0 ng/ml versus 117+/-49.2 ng/ml; P<0.001).
In conclusion, itraconazole decreases the clearance and increases the elimination half-life of intravenously administered methylprednisolone, resulting in greatly increased exposure to methylprednisolone during the night time and in enhanced adrenal suppression.
The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous ondansetron.
Ondansetron is an antiemetic agent metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Rifampin (INN, rifampicin) is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and some other CYP enzymes.
We examined the possible effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered ondansetron.
In a randomized crossover study with 4 phases and a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers took either 600 mg rifampin (in 2 phases) or placebo (in 2 phases) once a day for 5 days.
On day 6, 8 mg ondansetron was administered either orally (after rifampin and placebo) or intravenously (after rifampin and placebo).
Ondansetron concentrations in plasma were measured up to 12 hours.
The interaction is most likely the result of induction of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of ondansetron.
The mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of orally administered ondansetron after rifampin pretreatment was reduced by 65% compared with placebo (P < .001).
Rifampin decreased the peak plasma concentration of oral ondansetron by about 50% (from 27.2+/-3.0 to 13.8+/-1.5 ng/mL [mean +/- SEM]; P < .001]) and the elimination half-life (t1/2) by 38% (P < .01).
The bioavailability of oral ondansetron was reduced from 60% to 40% (P < .01) by rifampin.
The clearance of intravenous ondansetron was increased 83% (from 440+/-38.4 to 805+/-44.6 mL/min [P < .001]) by rifampin.
Rifampin reduced the t1/2 of intravenously administered ondansetron by 46% (P < .001) and the AUC(0-infinity) by 48% (P < .001).
Rifampin considerably decreases the plasma concentrations of ondansetron after both oral and intravenous administration.
Concomitant use of rifampin or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 with ondansetron may result in a reduced antiemetic effect, particularly after oral administration of ondansetron.
The effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of nisoldipine.
The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of nisoldipine.
A single dose of nisoldipine 5 mg immediate-release tablet was administered either alone or in combination with ketoconazole 200 mg (4 days pretreatment and concomitant administration) in a randomized crossover trial in seven healthy male CAUCasian volunteers.
Plasma concentration-versus-time profiles of nisoldipine and its metabolite M9 were determined.
The ketoconazole-induced increase in plasma concentration of the metabolite M9 was of similar magnitude.
The interaction is attributed to inhibition of cytochrome 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism.
Ketoconazole and other antifungal drugs of the substituted imidazole type as well as other potent inhibitors of cytochrome 3A4 should not be used concomitantly with nisoldipine.
Pre-treatment with and concomitant administration of ketoconazole resulted in a 24-fold and 11-fold, increase in mean AUC and Cmax of nisoldipine, respectively, compared with treatment with nisoldipine 5 mg alone.
Effect of erythromycin and itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine.
Lignocaine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4), and has a moderate to high extraction ratio resulting in oral bioavailability of 30%.
We have studied the possible effect of two inhibitors of CYP3A4, erythromycin and itraconazole, on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine in nine volunteers using a cross-over study design.
The subjects were given erythromycin orally (500 mg three times a day), itraconazole (200 mg once a day) or placebo for four days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single dose of 1 mg/kg of oral lignocaine.
Plasma samples were collected until 10 hr and concentrations of lignocaine and its major metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide were measured by gas chromatography.
Compared to placebo and itraconazole, erythromycin increased monoethylglycinexylidide peak concentrations by approximately 40% (P<0.01) and AUC(0-infinity) by 60% (P<0.01).
The extent of the interaction of lignocaine with these CYP3A4 inhibitors was, however, less than that of, e.g. midazolam or buspirone, and it did not correlate with the CYP3A4 inhibiting potency of erythromycin and itraconazole.
Both erythromycin and itraconazole increased the area under the lignocaine plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] and lignocaine peak concentrations by 40-70% (P<0.05).
The clinical implication of this study is that erythromycin and itraconazole may significantly increase the plasma concentrations and toxicity of oral lignocaine.
Effect of itraconazole on cerivastatin pharmacokinetics.
To determine the effects of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin, a competitive 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor.
A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study design with two phases, which were separated by a washout period of 4 weeks, was used.
In each phase ten healthy volunteers took 200 mg itraconazole or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days according to a randomization schedule.
On day 4, 0.3 mg cerivastatin was administered orally.
Serum concentrations of cerivastatin, its major metabolites, active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured up to 24 h. "
The AUC(0-24h) and t1/2 of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased by 27% (P < 0.05) and 40% (P < 0.05), respectively, by itraconazole.
Inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated M-1 metabolic pathway leads to elevated serum concentrations of cerivastatin, cerivastatin lactone and metabolite M-23, resulting in increased concentrations of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
Itraconazole increased the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of the parent cerivastatin by 15% (P < 0.05).
The mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of cerivastatin lactone was increased 1.8-fold (range 1.1-fold to 2.4-fold, P < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24h) 2.6-fold (range 2.0-fold to 3.6-fold, P < 0.001) by itraconazole.
The elimination half-life (t1/2) of cerivastatin lactone was increased 3.2-fold (P < 0.001).
Itraconazole decreased the AUC(0-24h) of the active M-1 metabolite of cerivastatin by 28% (P < 0.05), whereas the AUC(0- 24h) of the more active metabolite, M-23, was increased by 36% (P < 0.05).
Itraconazole has a modest interaction with cerivastatin.
Effects of rifampin on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
Tacrolimus is a marketed immunosuppressant used in liver and kidney transplantation.
It is subject to extensive metabolism by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.
A pharmacokinetic interaction with rifampin, an antituberculosis agent and potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and tacrolimus was evaluated in six healthy male volunteers.
Tacrolimus was administered at doses of 0.1 mg/kg orally and 0.025 mg/kg/4 hours intravenously.
The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus were obtained from serial blood samples collected over 96 hours, after single oral and intravenous administration prior to and during an 18-day concomitant rifampin dosing phase.
Coadministration of rifampin significantly increased tacrolimus clearance (36.0 +/- 8.1 ml/hr/kg vs. 52.8 +/- 9.6 ml/hr/kg; p = 0.03) and decreased tacrolimus bioavailability (14.4% +/- 5.7% vs. 7.0% +/- 2.7%; p = 0.03).
Rifampin appears to induce both intestinal and hepatic metabolism of tacrolimus, most likely through induction of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in the liver and small bowel.
Tamoxifen and toremifene concentrations in plasma are greatly decreased by rifampin.
Rifampin (INN, rifampicin) is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in drug metabolism and therefore causes many drug interactions.
The effects of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen (study I) and toremifene (study II) were examined in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled crossover studies.
Ten (study I) or 9 (study II) healthy male volunteers took either 600 mg rifampin or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
On the sixth day, 80 mg tamoxifen or 120 mg toremifene was administered orally.
Blood samples were collected up to 336 hours after drug administration.
Concomitant use of rifampin or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 with tamoxifen and toremifene may reduce the efficacy of these antiestrogens.
Rifampin reduced the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of tamoxifen by 86% (P < .001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 55% (P < .001), and elimination half-life (t1/2) by 44% (P < .001).
The AUC of toremifene was reduced by 87% (P < .001), Cmax by 55% (P < .001), and t1/2 by 44% (P < .01) with rifampin.
During the rifampin phase, the AUC of N-demethyltamoxifen was 38% (P < .001) and the AUC of N-demethyltoremifene was 20% (P < .01) of that during the placebo phase.
Rifampin markedly reduces the plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and toremifene by inducing their CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.
Concurrent administration of donepezil HCl and ketoconazole: assessment of pharmacokinetic changes following single and multiple doses.
The aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of donepezil HCl and ketoconazole separately, and in combination, following administration of single and multiple oral doses.
This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study in healthy volunteers (n=21).
During each treatment period, subjects received single daily doses of either donepezil HCl (5 mg), ketoconazole (200 mg), or a combination of both drugs for 7 consecutive days.
Pharmacokinetic comparisons were made between treatment groups for the day 1 and day 7 profiles.
Each treatment period was followed by a 3-week, drug-free washout period.
The concurrent administration of both drugs resulted in a 12% greater Cmax (9.5 ng ml(-1) versus 8.4 ng ml(-1); P=0.01) and a 12% greater AUC(0-24) (135.2 ng h ml(-1) versus 118.7 ng h ml(-1); P=0.001) than donepezil alone on day 1, and a 26.8% greater Cmax (37.7 ng ml(-1) versus 27.6 ng ml(-1); P < 0.0001) and a 26.4% greater AUC(0-24) (680.9 ng h ml(-1) versus 501.0 ng h ml(-1); P<0.0001) than donepezil alone on day 7.
These observed changes, which are smaller than those produced by ketoconazole for other agents sharing the CYP-3A4 pathway, are most likely the result of donepezil also being metabolized by CYP-2D6, as well as its slow rate of clearance from plasma.
On both day 1 and day 7, a statistically significant difference was observed between the donepezil and the donepezil + ketoconazole treatment groups in terms of Cmax and AUC(0-24) of donepezil.
In contrast, ketoconazole plasma concentrations were unaffected by the concurrent administration of donepezil, and there were no statistically significant differences in ketoconazole pharmacokinetics when ketoconazole administered alone was compared with ketoconazole administered with donepezil.
The concurrent administration of ketoconazole and donepezil produces no change in ketoconazole plasma concentrations, but a statistically significant change in donepezil plasma concentrations.
Metabolism of ropivacaine in humans is mediated by CYP1A2 and to a minor extent by CYP3A4: an interaction study with fluvoxamine and ketoconazole as in vivo inhibitors.
Potential drug-drug interactions can be identified in vitro by exploring the importance of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes for drug metabolism.
The metabolism of the local anesthetic ropivacaine to 3-hydroxyropivacaine and (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide was shown in vitro to be dependent on CYP1A2 and 3A4, respectively.
In this in vivo model study we quantitated the role of these 2 isozymes for the metabolism of ropivacaine.
In a randomized, 3-way crossover study, 12 healthy subjects received a single dose of 40 mg ropivacaine intravenously alone or combined either with 25 mg fluvoxamine as a CYP1A2 inhibitor or with 100 mg ketoconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor twice daily for 2 days.
Venous plasma and urine samples were collected over 10 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
The samples were analyzed for ropivacaine base, 3-hydroxyropivacaine, and (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide.
The relative changes in unbound plasma clearance were similar to the changes in total plasma clearance.
Coadministration with ketoconazole almost abolished the (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide concentrations in plasma, whereas fluvoxamine administration increased the (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide levels.
The fraction of dose excreted as 3-hydroxyropivacaine in urine decreased during fluvoxamine administration from 39% to 13%.
CYP1A2 is the most important isozyme for the metabolism of ropivacaine.
Drug-drug interactions with strong inhibitors of this isozyme could be of clinical relevance during repeated administration.
A potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 causes a minor decrease in clearance, which should be of no clinical relevance.
Coadministration with fluvoxamine decreased the mean total plasma clearance of ropivacaine from 354 to 112 mL/min (68%), whereas ketoconazole decreased plasma clearance to 302 mL/min (15%).
The ropivacaine half-life (t1/2) of 1.9 hours was almost doubled during fluvoxamine administration and the plasma concentration at the end of infusion increased slightly, whereas the corresponding parameters after ketoconazole administration remained unchanged.
Effect of erythromycin and itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous lignocaine.
We have studied the possible interaction of erythromycin and itraconazole, both inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4), with intravenous lignocaine in nine healthy volunteers using a randomized cross-over study design.
The subjects were given oral placebo, erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) or itraconazole (200 mg once a day) for 4 days.
Intravenous lignocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) was given with an infusion for 60 min on the fourth day of pretreatment with placebo, erythromycin or itraconazole.
Timed plasma samples were collected until 11 h. The concentrations of lignocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were measured by gas chromatography.
Following itraconazole administration, t1/2 was 2.6 h. The values for plasma clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were similar during all the phases.
Further studies are necessary to elucidate the clinical significance of the erythromycin-induced elevated concentrations of MEGX during prolonged intravenous infusions of lignocaine.
The area under the lignocaine concentration-time curve was similar during all three phases but erythromycin significantly increased the elimination half-life of lignocaine from 2.5 to 2.9 (0.7) h compared with placebo.
Compared with placebo and itraconazole, erythromycin significantly increased MEGX peak concentrations by approximately 40% and AUC(0-11 h) by 45-60%.
The plasma decay of lignocaine administered intravenously is virtually unaffected by the concomitant administration of erythromycin and itraconazole.
However, erythromycin increases the concentrations of MEGX, which indicates that erythromycin either increases the relative amount of lignocaine metabolized via N-de-ethylation or decreases the further metabolism of MEGX.
Effect of itraconazole on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam.
To assess the effect of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam, the study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover manner with two phases of treatment with itraconazole-placebo or placebo-itraconazole.
Ten healthy male subjects receiving itraconazole 200 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam on day 4 of each treatment phase.
Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske undersøgelser side effect rating scale.
The test performed during itraconazole treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function.
Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of alprazolam.
Itraconazole significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 ng h/ml), decreased the apparent oral clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.10 ml/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of alprazolam.
It is suggested that itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases plasma concentration of alprazolam via its inhibitory effects on alprazolam metabolism.
Enhanced side effects of alprazolam by itraconazole coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes.
Effect of fluvoxamine therapy on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A as determined by phenotyping.
To determine the effect of 150 mg/day fluvoxamine on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A, N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2), and xanthine oxidase (XO) by phenotyping with caffeine, dextromethorphan, and midazolam.
Oral caffeine (2 mg/kg), oral dextromethorphan (30 mg), and intravenous midazolam (0.025 mg/kg) were administered to 10 white male volunteers every 14 days for 4 months and to 10 white premenopausal female volunteers during the midfollicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle for 4 complete cycles (8 total phenotyping measures).
The first 6 phenotyping measures were used to establish baseline activity.
Subjects were given 150 mg/day fluvoxamine for the fourth month or cycle of the study.
Enzyme activity for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, NAT2, and XO was expressed as urinary metabolite ratios.
Midazolam plasma clearance was used to express CYP3A activity.
No difference between baseline and weeks 2 and 4 of fluvoxamine therapy was observed for NAT2 or XO metabolite ratios.
For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A phenotypes, significant differences existed between baseline and fluvoxamine therapy.
For CYP1A2, the mean urinary metabolite ratio (+/-SD) was 7.53 +/- 7.44 at baseline and 4.30 +/- 2.82 with fluvoxamine ( P = .012).
Mean CYP2D6 molar urinary dextromethorphan ratios before and after fluvoxamine therapy were 0.00780 +/- 0.00694 and 0.0153 +/- 0.0127, respectively (P = .011).
Midazolam clearance decreased from 0.0081 +/ 0.0024 L/min/kg at baseline to 0.0054 +/- 0.0021 L/min/kg with therapy (P = .0091).
For CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, fluvoxamine therapy changed the phenotyping measures by a median of -44.4%, 123.5%, and -34.4%, respectively.
We concluded that fluvoxamine may cause significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A activity.
This metabolic inhibition may have serious implications for a variety medications.
Erythromycin and verapamil considerably increase serum simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations.
To study the effects of erythromycin and verapamil on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase.
A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three phases separated by a washout period of 3 weeks.
Twelve young, healthy volunteers took orally either 1.5 gm/day erythromycin, 240 mg/day verapamil, or placebo for 2 days.
On day 2, 40 mg simvastatin was administered orally.
Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, erythromycin, verapamil, and norverapamil were measured for up to 24 hours.
There was more than tenfold interindividual variability in the extent of simvastatin interaction with both erythromycin and verapamil.
Concomitant administration of erythromycin, verapamil, or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with simvastatin should be avoided.
As an alternative, the dosage of simvastatin should be reduced considerably, that is, by about 50% to 80%, at least when a simvastatin dosage higher than 20 mg/day is used.
Possible adverse effects, such as elevation of creatine kinase level and muscle tenderness, should be closely monitored when such combinations are used.
Erythromycin and verapamil increased mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.05) and the area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] 6.2-fold(p < 0.001) and 4.6-fold (p < 0.01).
Erythromycin increased the mean Cmax of active simvastatin acid fivefold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 3.9-fold (p < 0.001).
Verapamil increased the Cmax of simvastatin acid 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 2.8-fold (p < 0.001).
Both erythromycin and verapamil interact considerably with simvastatin, probably by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism.
Artemisinin induces omeprazole metabolism in human beings.
This study investigated whether time-dependent artemisinin pharmacokinetics correlated to CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 activity in vivo.
Artemisinin (two oral doses per day of 250 mg) was given to nine healthy Vietnamese subjects for 7 days (day 1 to day 7).
Single 20 mg doses of omeprazole were given orally on day -7, day 1, and day 7.
Single doses of artemisinin and omeprazole were given in combination on day 14 after a 6-day washout period.
The pharmacokinetics of artemisinin, omeprazole, hydroxyomeprazole, and omeprazole sulfone were evaluated on days -7, 1, 7, and 14.
On the same days urine was collected for the determination of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and cortisol excretion.
Areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) for artemisinin and omeprazole decreased on day 7 to 20% (95% confidence intervals, 13%, 28%) and 35% (25%, 46%), respectively, compared with values on day 1.
AUC ratios for hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole increased 2.2-fold (1.7, 2.7) on day 7 compared with values on day 1.
All values were normalized at day 14.
There were no significant changes in the omeprazole sulfone/omeprazole ratio or in the 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio between the study days.
In one subject found to have poor CYP2C19 metabolization, the elimination of omeprazole increased after artemisinin exposure, with no change in the hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole AUC ratio.
Artemisinin did not alter CYP3A4 activity, whereas an increase in CYP2C19 activity was observed.
The increased elimination of omeprazole in both poor and extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers suggests artemisinin induces both CYP2C19 and another enzyme.
Different effects of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin and lovastatin.
The effects of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin and lovastatin, two inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase with different pharmacokinetic properties, were studied.
Two separate randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over studies, each involving 10 healthy volunteers, were carried out.
The general design was identical in both studies.
The subjects took either 100 mg itraconazole or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days.
On day 4, 40 mg fluvastatin or 40 mg lovastatin was administered orally.
Plasma concentrations of fluvastatin, lovastatin, lovastatin acid, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were determined up to 24 h. "
The t1/2,z of lovastatin averaged 3.7 +/- 3.8 h and that of lovastatin acid 4.7 +/- 4.0 h during the itraconazole phase; these variables could not be determined in all subjects during the placebo phase.
Lovastatin should therefore not be used concomitantly with itraconazole and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, or the dosage of lovastatin should be greatly reduced while using a CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Itraconazole had no significant effect on the Cmax (190 +/- 124 ng ml(-1) vs 197 +/- 189 ng ml(-1) (mean +/- s.d.)) or total AUC (368 +/- 153 ng ml(-1) h vs 324 +/- 155 ng ml(-1) h) of fluvastatin compared with placebo.
However, the t1/2,z of fluvastatin was slightly prolonged by itraconazole (2.8 +/- 0.49 h vs 2.4 +/- 0.51 h; P < 0.05).
The Cmax of lovastatin was increased about 15-fold (P < 0.01) and the total AUC more than 15-fold (P < 0.01) by itraconazole.
Similarly, the Cmax and total AUC of lovastatin acid were increased about 12-fold (95% CI, 5.3 to 17.7-fold; P < 0.01) and 15-fold (95% CI, 4.6 to 26.2-fold; P < 0.01) by itraconazole, respectively.
Itraconazole, even at a small dosage of 100 mg daily, greatly elevated plasma concentrations of lovastatin and its active metabolite, lovastatin acid.
In contrast, fluvastatin concentrations were not significantly increased by itraconazole, indicating that fluvastatin has much less potential than lovastatin for clinically significant interactions with itraconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Effects of verapamil and diltiazem on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of buspirone.
Buspirone has an extensive first-pass metabolism, which makes it potentially susceptible to drug interactions.
The aim of this study was to investigate possible interactions of buspirone with verapamil and diltiazem.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, three-phase crossover study, nine healthy volunteers received either 80 mg verapamil, 60 mg diltiazem, or placebo orally three times a day.
On day 2, after the fifth dose, 10 mg buspirone was given orally.
Plasma concentrations of buspirone, verapamil, and diltiazem were determined up to 18 hours, and the effects of buspirone were measured up to 8 hours.
The effect of diltiazem on the AUC(0-infinity) of buspirone was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than that of verapamil.
Side effects of buspirone occurred more often (p < 0.05) with diltiazem than with placebo.
Thus enhanced effects and side effects of buspirone are possible when it is used with verapamil, diltiazem, or other inhibitors of CYP3A4.
Verapamil and diltiazem increased the area under the buspirone plasma concentration-time curve [AUC (0-infinity)] 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 5.5-fold (p < 0.001), respectively.
The peak plasma concentration of buspirone was increased 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.1-fold (p < 0.001) by verapamil and diltiazem, respectively.
The elimination half-life of buspirone was not changed by verapamil and diltiazem.
Of the six pharmacodynamic variables, only the subjective overall drug effect of buspirone was significantly increased with verapamil (p < 0.05) and diltiazem (p < 0.05).
Both verapamil and diltiazem considerably increase plasma buspirone concentrations, probably by inhibiting its CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism.
Concentrations and effects of buspirone are considerably reduced by rifampicin.
The effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, were investigated.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study with two phases, 10 young healthy volunteers took either 600 mg rifampicin or matched placebo once daily for 5 days.
On day 6, 30 mg buspirone was administered orally.
Plasma buspirone concentrations and effects of buspirone were measured up to 10 h. "
A significant (P<0.05) reduction in the effects of buspirone was observed in three of the six psychomotor tests employed (postural sway test with eyes closed, subjective drowsiness and overall drug effect) after rifampicin pretreatment.
Buspirone will most likely show a greatly reduced anxiolytic effect when used together with rifampicin or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenytoin and carbamazepine.
The total area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time curve after rifampicin was 10.4% (95% CI, 6.3-14.5%) of that after placebo (1.64+/-0.35 ng ml(-1) h vs 22.0+/-15.1 ng ml(-1) h (mean+/-s.d.); P< 0.01).
rifampicin decreased the peak plasma concentration of buspirone from 6.6+/-3.7 ng ml(-1) to 0.84+/-0.23 ng ml(-1) (P< 0.01) and the half-life from 2.8+/-0.7 h to 1.3+/-0.5 h (P< 0.01).
The strong interaction between rifampicin and buspirone is probably mostly due to enhanced CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of buspirone.
Effects of erythromycin or rifampin on losartan pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
Losartan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, E3174, which has greater antihypertensive activity than the parent compound.
Coadministered drugs that inhibit or induce metabolic processes may therefore alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic response of losartan and E3174.
Ten healthy volunteers were studied to assess the effects of CYP3A4 inhibition and nonspecific P450 enzyme induction on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174.
Subjects completed three 1-week phases separated by 6 days: 50 mg losartan every morning, losartan plus 500 mg erythromycin four times a day, and losartan plus 300 mg rifampin (INN, rifampicin) twice a day.
On the eighth day of each phase, serial plasma concentrations of losartan and E3174 were obtained over 32 hours and steady-state pharmacokinetics were determined.
The half-life values of both compounds were decreased by 50% (p < 0.005).
Given the magnitude of the effect, this interaction is likely to be clinically significant.
On the basis of the minimal inhibitory effects observed with erythromycin, CYP3A4 appears to play a minor role in the in vivo metabolism of losartan to E3174.
Further studies are needed to define the contribution of other isozymes, particularly CYP2C9, to the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E3174.
Rifampin decreased the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours after the dose (AUC [0-24]) of losartan by 35% (349 +/- 246 versus 225 +/- 130; p = 0.0001) and decreased the AUC(0-24) of E3174 by 40% (1336 +/- 445 versus 792 +/- 302; p < 0.005).
Losartan oral clearance was increased by 44% (p = 0.0001).
In contrast, erythromycin did not significantly affect the AUC(0-24) or half-life of either losartan or E3174.
Rifampin is a potent inducer of losartan and E3174 elimination.
Simvastatin but not pravastatin is very susceptible to interaction with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole.
Itraconazole increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A' (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations.
We studied possible interactions of itraconazole with simvastatin and pravastatin.
Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with simvastatin (study I) and one with pravastatin (study II).
In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II).
Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined.
The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of total simvastatin acid (naive simvastatin acid plus that derived by hydrolysis of the lactone) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05).
The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001).
The t1/2 was not altered.
The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by itraconazole.
There were no differences in the serum concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole between studies I and II.
Concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A with simvastatin should be avoided or its dosage should be greatly reduced.
In study I, itraconazole increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of simvastatin and simvastatin acid at least tenfold (p < 0.001).
In study II, itraconazole slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of pravastatin, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively).
Itraconazole greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism, but it had only a minor effect on pravastatin.
Effect of carbamazepine on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.
The effect of carbamazepine, an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of alprazolam was examined in a double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases.
Seven healthy male subjects took carbamazepine 300 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 10 days, and on the 8th day they took a single oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam.
Blood samples were taken and psychomotor function was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale, and UKU Side Effect Rating Scale up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing.
The majority of psychomotor function parameters during the carbamazepine treatment were not significantly different from those during the placebo treatment, probably because of the sedative effect of carbamazepine itself.
It also supports the previous studies, suggesting that alprazolam is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4.
Carbamazepine significantly (p < .01 to .001) decreased the plasma alprazolam concentrations during the elimination phase.
Carbamazepine significantly (p < .001) increased the apparent oral clearance (0.90 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.54 ml/min/kg) and shortened the elimination half-life (17.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.7 h), with no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (11.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 13.0 +/- 3.5 ng/ml).
The present study suggests that carbamazepine decreases plasma concentration of alprazolam by inducing its metabolism.
Itraconazole decreases renal clearance of digoxin.
Itraconazole strongly interacts with some drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, for example, felodipine and lovastatin, by inhibiting their metabolism.
A concomitant use of itraconazole increases the serum concentrations of digoxin, although digoxin is excreted mainly unchanged in urine.
To reveal the mechanism of the itraconazole-digoxin interaction, the effect of itraconazole on the serum concentrations and urinary excretion of digoxin was studied.
Ten healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 5 days.
On day 3, each volunteer ingested a single 0.5-mg oral dose of digoxin.
The serum concentrations of digoxin and its excretion into urine as well as plasma concentrations of itraconazole were determined up to 72 hours after dosing.
The decreased renal clearance of digoxin during the itraconazole phase partially explains increased concentrations of digoxin during their concomitant use and may be caused by the inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin secretion in the renal tubular cells.
The mean area under the serum digoxin concentration-time curve, AUC(0-72), was approximately 50% higher (P < 0.001) during the itraconazole phase than during the placebo phase.
In addition, the renal clearance of digoxin decreased about 20% (P < 0.01) by itraconazole.
The increases in digoxin Cmax and t(1/2) by itraconazole were not statistically significant.
Enhanced effect of triazolam with diltiazem.
Triazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme.
The aim of this study was to determine if diltiazem affects plasma concentrations of triazolam in humans.
We investigated the interaction between triazolam and diltiazem in a randomized, three-phase crossover study.
Seven healthy male volunteers received orally either a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam, a 0.25 mg dose of triazolam after a 3-day treatment of diltiazem (180 mg day-1), or a placebo.
Plasma samples were collected to determine triazolam concentration over a 24 h period.
The pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam were investigated using the peak saccadic velocity of eye movements (PSV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual analogue scale (VAS) through 8 h. "
The PSV, EEG, and VAS of the triazolam plus diltiazem group revealed significant differences from the triazolam alone group or the control placebo group.
Inhibition of CYP3A isozyme by diltiazem may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction.
Therefore, triazolam should be avoided when patients are using diltiazem.
Diltiazem pretreatment significantly increased the area under the triazolam concentration-time curve (8.0 +/- 2.4 to 18.2 +/- 3.1 ng ml-1 h; P < 0.001; mean +/- s.d.).
Peak triazolam concentration was increased (2.1 +/- 0.7 to 3.6 +/- 1.0 ng ml-1, P < 0.05) and the elimination half-life prolonged (4.1 +/- 2.1 to 7.6 +/- 1.9 h; P < 0.01).
Diltiazem markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of triazolam and increases the intensity of its sedative effects.
Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations and effects of felodipine.
Felodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4.
Itraconazole strongly interacts with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., terfenadine, triazolam and lovastatin); hence it is important to uncover the possible interaction of itraconazole with felodipine.
A double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover design was used to investigate the interaction between felodipine and itraconazole.
Nine healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 5 mg oral dose of felodipine.
Plasma concentrations of felodipine and itraconazole were determined and systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were measured up to 32 hours.
In seven of the nine subjects, even the Cmax of felodipine was lower without itraconazole than the 32-hour concentrations during the itraconazole phase.
The decreases in blood pressure and the increases in heart rate were significantly greater during the itraconazole phase than during the placebo phase.
The inhibition of CYP3A4 during the first-pass and elimination phases of felodipine seems to be the mechanism of the observed interaction.
The concomitant use of itraconazole and some other azole antifungals with felodipine and other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should be avoided or their doses should be reduced accordingly.
On average, itraconazole increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of felodipine nearly eightfold (p < 0.001), the areas under the felodipine concentration-time curve [AUC(0-32) and AUC(0-infinity)] about sixfold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life twofold (p < 0.05).
Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations and effects of oral felodipine.
Effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of imipramine and desipramine in healthy subjects.
The aim of the study was to characterize further the role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants.
The effect of oral ketoconazole (200 mg day-1 for 14 days) on the kinetics of a single oral dose of imipramine (100 mg) and desipramine (100 mg) was evaluated in two groups of six healthy male subjects.
In the subjects given desipramine, no significant changes in desipramine and 2-hydroxy-desipramine kinetics were observed during ketoconazole treatment.
This interaction, confirms that CYP3A4 plays a role in the demethylation of tricyclic antidepressants.
Ketoconazole administration was associated with a decrease in imipramine apparent oral clearance (from 1.16 +/- 0.21 to 0.96 +/- 0.20 l h-1 kg-1, mean +/- s.d.; P < 0.02), a prolongation in imipramine half-life (from 16.7 +/- 3.3 to 19.2 +/- 5.4 h, P < 0.05) and a decrease in area under the curve of metabolically derived desipramine (from 3507 +/- 1707 to 3180 +/- 1505 nmol l-1 h, P < 0.05), whereas concentrations of 2-hydroxy-imipramine were unaffected.
These findings indicate that ketoconazole, a relatively specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the N-demethylation of imipramine without affecting the 2-hydroxylation of imipramine and desipramine.
A study of the potential effect of sertraline on the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of tolbutamide.
The effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline 200 mg/day on the metabolism of intravenously administered tolbutamide was examined in a randomised nonblinded parallel-group study in 25 healthy male volunteers.
The terminal elimination rate constant was also significantly reduced, corresponding to the increase in the terminal elimination half-life (from 6.9 to 8.6 hours).
The decrease in clearance was not associated with any significant changes in plasma protein binding or in the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide.
There was a small but statistically significant decrease (16%) in the clearance of tolbutamide in patients receiving the maximum recommended dosage of sertraline.
This suggests that the change in tolbutamide clearance may be due to a slight inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP2C9/10 when sertraline was administered in its maximum recommended dosage.
However, the small changes in the volume of distribution and plasma binding of tolbutamide after sertraline treatment indicate that there is a minimal interaction between sertraline and tolbutamide.
Effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam.
Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme.
Orally ingested azole antimycotics, including fluconazole, interfere with the metabolism of oral midazolam during its absorption and elimination phases.
We compared the effect of oral and intravenous fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally ingested midazolam.
A double-dummy, randomized, cross-over study in three phases was performed in 9 healthy volunteers.
The subjects were given orally fluconazole 400 mg and intravenously saline within 60 min; orally placebo and intravenously fluconazole 400 mg; and orally placebo and intravenously saline.
An oral dose of 7.5 mg midazolam was ingested 60 min after oral intake of fluconazole/placebo, i.e. at the end of the corresponding infusion.
Plasma concentrations of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and fluconazole were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h. "
We conclude that the metabolism of orally administered midazolam was more strongly inhibited by oral than by intravenous administration of fluconazole.
Both oral and intravenous fluconazole significantly increased the area under the midazolam plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-3, AUC0-17) 2- to 3-fold, the elimination half-life of midazolam 2.5-fold and its peak concentration (Cmax) 2- to 2.5-fold compared with placebo.
The AUC0-3 and the Cmax of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than after intravenous administration of fluconazole.
Both oral and intravenous fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam but no differences were detected between the fluconazole phases.
The nifedipine-rifampin interaction. Evidence for induction of gut wall metabolism.
The calcium channel blocker nifedipine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, which is present in liver and mucosa of the small bowel.
Cytochrome P450 3A4 is inducible by the tuberculostatic rifampin in liver and the small bowel.
The contribution of gut wall metabolism to total clearance of nifedipine before and during induction has not been determined in detail.
We therefore investigated the nifedipine-rifampin interaction, with special emphasis on the contribution of gut wall metabolism to total metabolism of nifedipine before and during administration of rifampin.
Pharmacokinetics of nifedipine were studied in six healthy volunteers on separate days by administration of 20 micrograms/kg body weight nifedipine iv and 20 mg nifedipine orally before and after 7 days of rifampin treatment (600 mg/day).
Enzyme induction did not significantly alter pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after iv administration.
We conclude that there is a relevant interaction between nifedipine and rifampin.
The reduction of nifedipine bioavailability during enzyme induction is most likely due to rifampin-induced gut wall metabolism.
In contrast, oral clearance of nifedipine increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 liters/min to 20.9 +/- 8.3 liters/min (p < 0.01) and bioavailability decreased from 41.2 +/- 5.4% to 5.3 +/- 2.7% (p < 0.001).
Although hepatic extraction of nifedipine was not significantly altered during induction (47.4 +/- 6.6% versus 67.4 +/- 20.2%; ns), the calculated extraction of nifedipine in gut wall mucosa increased from 21.8 +/- 13.3% to 75.8 +/- 28.2% (p < 0.05).
Differential induction of prehepatic and hepatic metabolism of verapamil by rifampin.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which metabolize numerous drugs, are expressed both in liver and in extrahepatic tissues.
CYP3A4 for example is present and inducible by rifampin in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract.
It has been shown that such prehepatic metabolism contributes substantially to total clearance of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., cyclosporine) before and even more pronounced during enzyme induction.
We examined the effect of enzyme induction on prehepatic and hepatic metabolism of the model compound R/S-verapamil after simultaneous oral and intravenous administration using a stable isotope technology.
This approach allows us to exclude intraindividual day-to-day variability and is therefore suitable to quantitatively assess prehepatic extraction of high-clearance drugs.
Moreover, because verapamil is administered as a race-mate with the S-enantiomer being preferentially metabolized, we investigated the influence of induction on stereoselectivity of prehepatic and hepatic metabolism.
Eight male volunteers received 120 mg of racemic verapamil bid for 24 days.
Rifampin (600 mg daily) was given from day 5 to day 16.
Systemic clearance and bioavailability of the verapamil enantiomers were determined by coadministering deuterated verapamil intravenously on day 4, on day 16, and on day 24.
Effects of verapamil on atrioventricular conduction after oral and intravenous (iv) administration were assessed by measuring the maximum PR-interval prolongation Rifampin increased the systemic clearance of the active S-verapamil 1.3-fold (P < .001).
With rifampin, the effect of oral verapamil on atrioventricular conduction was nearly abolished (P < .01), whereas no significant changes were observed after intravenous administration.
Induction caused a considerable reduction of stereoselectivity after both intravenous and oral administration (P < .001).
These data clearly indicate that prehepatic metabolism of verapamil (presumably in the gut wall) is preferentially induced compared with hepatic metabolism and that stereoselectivity of verapamil metabolism is affected by induction.
In contrast, rifampin increased the apparent oral clearance of S-verapamil 32-fold (P < .001) and decreased its bioavailability 25-fold (P < .001), with partial recovery after rifampin withdrawal (P < .01).
Rifampin altered the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacological effects of verapamil to a much greater extent after oral administration compared with intravenous administration.
Pharmacogenetic determination of the effects of codeine and prediction of drug interactions.
To define the differences in codeine pharmacodynamics in extensive (EMs) and poor (PMs) metabolizers of debrisoquin and to determine whether the inhibition of codeine's metabolism by quinidine produces phenotypically dependent pharmacodynamic changes, we studied 16 healthy nonsmoking males, 10 EMs and 6 PMs of debrisoquin.
The subjects received in random double-blind fashion 120 mg of codeine plus placebo, 120 mg of codeine plus 100 mg of quinidine and 100 mg of quinidine plus placebo.
Blood was obtained over 24 hr and urine was collected for 48 hr.
Respiratory, psychomotor and pupillary effects of codeine were greater in the EMs than in the PMs (P < .01).
Morphine and morphine metabolites were detectable only in plasma from EMs.
Codeine metabolic clearance by O-demethylation was almost 200-fold greater in the EMs than in the PMs.
After coadministration of quinidine, morphine and morphine metabolites were not detectable in the plasma of either phenotype and mean (+/- S.E.M.) O-demethylation clearance was reduced in the EMs from 162.7 +/- 36.6 to 17.0 +/- 5.0 ml/min (P < .003), but not in the PMs.
The diminished production of morphine in the EMs was associated with significantly reduced respiratory, psychomotor and pupillary effects (P < .01).
Thus, CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation of codeine to morphine is central to its pharmacodynamic effects.
Patients who lack CYP2D6 or whose CYP2D6 is inhibited would not be expected to benefit from codeine.
Thus, phenotyping for CYP2D6 and the avoidance of CYP2D6 inhibitors is justified in patients with chronic path before initiating long-term therapy with analgesics whose in vivo activation is dependent on CYP2D6 activity (i.e., codeine, hydrocodone and oxycodone.
Itraconazole drastically increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid.
Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that can cause myopathy as a rare side effect.
Concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity.
Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Because itraconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between these drugs.
In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of lovastatin.
Plasma concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole, and creatine kinase were measured up to 24 hours.
The mean Cmax of the active metabolite, lovastatin acid, was increased 13-fold (range, tenfold to 23-fold; p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) twentyfold (p < 0.001).
No increase in creatine kinase was observed in the other subjects.
Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism probably explains the increased toxicity of lovastatin caused not only by itraconazole but also by cyclosporine, erythromycin, and other inhibitors of CYP3A4.
Their concomitant use with lovastatin and simvastatin should be avoided, or the dose of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.
On average, itraconazole increased the peak concentration (Cmax) of lovastatin and the area under the lovastatin concentration-time curve (AUC) more than twentyfold (p < 0.001).
In one subject plasma creatine kinase was increased tenfold within 24 hours of lovastatin administration during the itraconazole phase but not during the placebo phase.
Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid.
Fluconazole, but not terbinafine, enhances the effects of triazolam by inhibiting its metabolism.
1.
The interaction between triazolam and two antifungal agents, fluconazole and terbinafine, was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of three phases.
2.
Twelve healthy young volunteers received 100 mg fluconazole, 250 mg terbinafine or placebo orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4 they took a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam.
Plasma samples were collected and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h after the intake of triazolam.
3.
4.
5.
6.
Care should be taken when triazolam is prescribed to patients using fluconazole.
Although the interaction is not as strong as that of triazolam with ketoconazole or itraconazole, it is clinically significant.
Triazolam and probably other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 can be used in normal doses with terbinafine.
Fluconazole increased the area under the triazolam concentration time-curve more than twofold (P < 0.001) and prolonged the elimination half-life of triazolam nearly twofold (P < 0.001).
The peak concentration of triazolam was also increased significantly (P < 0.05) by fluconazole.
During the fluconazole phase pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam (e.g. digit symbol substitution test, body sway and drowsiness) were enhanced significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with the placebo phase.
Terbinafine did not change significantly the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of triazolam.
Diltiazem enhances the effects of triazolam by inhibiting its metabolism.
Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4.
Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme and interacts with midazolam, another substrate of this enzyme.
Therefore the possible interaction between triazolam and diltiazem is worth investigation.
A balanced, randomized, double-blind crossover study design was used, with an interval of 2 weeks between phases.
Ten healthy volunteers were given 60 mg diltiazem orally or placebo three times a day for 2 days.
On the second day they received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam, after which plasma samples were collected and effects of triazolam measured for up to 17 hours.
The increased concentrations of triazolam during the diltiazem phase were associated with increased and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects.
Prescription of triazolam should be avoided if a patient is using diltiazem or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
Diltiazem increased the mean area under the triazolam concentration-time curve threefold (p < 0.001) and the elimination half-life (p < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration of triazolam twofold (p < 0.005).
Diltiazem has a clinically significant interaction with oral triazolam.
The data is highly suggestive that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of triazolam during the first-pass and elimination phases.
Metoprolol metabolism via cytochrome P4502D6 in ethnic populations.
The objective of this study was to determine whether metabolism via cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) was higher in Black subjects than White subjects.
Ten Black and 10 White healthy male volunteers who were phenotyped CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotypes participated in this randomized, cross-over study in which metoprolol was used as a model CYP2D6 substrate.
In both study phases, subjects received oral rac-metoprolol tartrate (200 mg); during one phase, subjects also took quinidine sulfate (100 mg) daily beginning 3 days before the dose of metoprolol.
Plasma samples were collected for 12 and 24 hr after the dose in the metoprolol and metoprolol plus quinidine phases, respectively.
Metoprolol enantiomer concentrations were determined by chiral HPLC with fluorescence detection.
S-metoprolol areas under the concentration vs. time curves during the metoprolol phase were 879 +/- 600 ng/ml*hr in White subjects vs. 984 +/- 653 ng/ml*hr in Black subjects.
During inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated metabolism with quinidine, S-metoprolol areas under the concentration vs. time curves were 2515 +/- 749 and 2719 +/- 742 in White and Black subjects, respectively.
Mean S-metoprolol/R-metoprolol ratios were 1.39 in both racial groups during the metoprolol phase, and during the metoprolol plus quinidine phase were 0.89 and 1.03 in White subjects and Black subjects, respectively (p < 0.05, Blacks vs. Whites).
The percentage of metoprolol metabolism inhibited by quinidine was similar between Blacks and Whites (e.g., 66 +/- 15% and 64 +/- 25% of S-metoprolol apparent oral clearance in Blacks and Whites, respectively).
We conclude that there are no differences between Black subjects and White subjects in metabolism via CYP2D6.
There were also no racial differences in the contribution of CYP2D6 to overall metoprolol metabolism.
The results of this study suggest that drugs are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 will not exhibit racial differences in their disposition.
Metoprolol elimination half-lives in both groups were approximately doubled by quinidine.
Oral triazolam is potentially hazardous to patients receiving systemic antimycotics ketoconazole or itraconazole.
Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4 isozyme.
Ketoconazole and itraconazole may seriously interact with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., terfenadine); hence their possible interaction with triazolam in humans is important to uncover.
In this double-blind, randomized, three-phase crossover study, the interaction between ketoconazole, itraconazole, and triazolam was investigated.
Nine healthy young volunteers received either 400 mg ketoconazole, 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo (control phase) orally once a day for 4 days.
On day 4, each ingested a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam.
Plasma concentrations of triazolam and antimycotics were determined, and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours.
In seven of the nine subjects, even the maximum concentration of triazolam in plasma was lower without the antimycotics than were the 17-hour concentrations during the ketoconazole and itraconazole phases.
All pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test) revealed a significant difference between the antimycotic and placebo phases.
Inhibition of CYP3A4 during the absorption and elimination phases of triazolam seems to explain the interaction observed.
Because of the potentially hazardous consequences of this interaction, triazolam should be avoided if patients are using ketoconazole or itraconazole.
On average, ketoconazole and itraconazole increased the area under the triazolam concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 22-fold and 27-fold (p < 0.001), the peak concentrations threefold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life sixfold and sevenfold (p < 0.001), respectively.
Both ketoconazole and itraconazole seriously affect the pharmacokinetics of triazolam and increase the intensity and duration of its effects.
CYP2D6 phenotype determines the metabolic conversion of hydrocodone to hydromorphone.
The contribution of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to the formation of hydrocodone's active metabolite, hydromorphone, was examined in vitro and in vivo.
Human liver microsomes prepared from an individual homozygous for the D6-B mutation of the CYP2D6 gene catalyzed this reaction at a negligible rate.
Urinary metabolic ratios of hydrocodone/hydromorphone were highly correlated with O-demethylation ratios for dextromethorphan, an established marker drug of CYP2D6 activity (rs = 0.85; n = 18).
The kinetics of hydrocodone after a single oral dose and its partial metabolic clearance to hydromorphone were investigated in five extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, six poor metabolizers, and four extensive metabolizers after pretreatment with quinidine, a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity.
The mean values for partial metabolic clearance by O-demethylation in the three groups were 28.1 +/- 10.3, 3.4 +/- 2.4, and 5.0 +/- 3.6 ml/hr/kg, respectively.
No statistically significant phenotypic differences in physiologic measures were observed.
However, over the first hour after dosing, the extensive metabolizers reported more \"good opiate effects\" and fewer \"bad opiate effects\" than poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers in whom CYP2D6 was inhibited by quinidine.
These data establish the importance of CYP2D6 in the formation of hydromorphone from hydrocodone and suggest that the activity of this enzyme may limit the abuse liability of hydrocodone.
Single-dose disulfiram inhibition of chlorzoxazone metabolism: a clinical probe for P450 2E1.
Disulfiram and its reduced metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate have been identified previously as selective mechanism-based inhibitors of human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2E1 in vitro.
In animals, a single oral dose of disulfiram has been shown to produce a rapid and selective inactivation of hepatic P450 2E1 content and catalytic activity in vivo.
This investigation explored the efficacy of single dose disulfiram as an inhibitor of human P450 2E1 activity in vivo.
Clinical P450 2E1 activity was assessed by the 6-hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, a metabolic pathway catalyzed selectively by P450 2E1.
Six healthy volunteers received 750 mg oral chlorzoxazone on two occasions in a crossover design, 10 hours after 500 mg oral disulfiram, or after no pretreatment (control subjects).
These findings show that a single dose of disulfiram significantly diminishes the activity of human P450 2E1 in vivo.
The efficacy of single-dose disulfiram as an inhibitor of human P450 2E1 suggests that this modality for manipulating clinical P450 2E1 activity may provide a useful probe for delineating P450 2E1 participation in human drug biotransformation or for the treatment of poisoning by P450 2E1-activated toxins.
Disulfiram pretreatment markedly decreased chlorzoxazone elimination clearance to 15% of control values (from 3.28 +/- 1.40 to 0.49 +/- 0.07 ml/kg/min, p < 0.005), prolonged the elimination half-life (from 0.92 +/- 0.32 to 5.1 +/- 0.9 hours, p < 0.001), and caused a twofold increase in peak plasma chlorzoxazone concentrations (20.6 +/- 9.9 versus 38.7 +/- 10.3 micrograms/ml, p < 0.001).
Disulfiram also profoundly decreased the formation clearance of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone, from 2.30 +/- 0.93 to 0.17 +/- 0.05 ml/kg/min (p < 0.005).
Effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of imipramine and desipramine in healthy subjects.
The effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine (100 mg/day for 10 consecutive days) on the kinetics of a single oral dose of imipramine (50 mg) and desipramine (100 mg) was investigated in 12 healthy subjects.
Compared with a control session, treatment with fluvoxamine caused a significant prolongation of imipramine half-life (from 22.8 +/- 6.4 to 40.5 +/- 5.0 h, means +/- SD, p < 0.01) and a marked decrease in imipramine apparent oral clearance (from 1.02 +/- 0.19 to 0.28 +/- 0.06 L/h/kg, p < 0.0001).
No significant changes in desipramine kinetics were observed during fluvoxamine treatment.
These findings indicate that, at the dosage tested, fluvoxamine markedly inhibits the demethylation of imipramine without affecting significantly the CYP2D6-mediated hydroxylation of desipramine.
Citalopram: interaction studies with levomepromazine, imipramine, and lithium.
The pharmacokinetic interactions between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, given as an oral dose of 40 mg/day for 10 days, and (1) levomepromazine (50 mg single oral dose), (2) imipramine (100 mg single oral dose), and (3) lithium (30 mmol/day orally for 5 days) were examined in three panels each of 8 healthy young male volunteers (age 20-31).
All volunteers were classified as extensive metabolizers of sparteine and mephenytoin.
Each subject completed three study phases--one with citalopram alone, one with one of the three other drugs, alone, and one with citalopram combined with the corresponding other drug.
For citalopram and its metabolites, a non-enantioselective analytical method (high-performance liquid chromatography) was used.
Only two statistically significant interactions were indicated.
These findings are in agreement with the recent observations that (1) the demethylation of desmethylcitalopram (to didesmethylcytalopram) is partly mediated via the sparteine/debrisoquine oxygenase (CYP2D6) and that levomepromazine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and (2) that desmethylcitalopram has a somewhat stronger affinity for CYP2D6 than desipramine, and therefore may inhibit the hydroxylation of desipramine, which is also a substrate of CYP2D6.
First, levomepromazine caused a 10-20% increase from the initial steady-state levels of the primary citalopram metabolite, desmethylcitalopram.
Second, citalopram caused approximately 50% increase in the single-dose area under the serum concentration/time curve of desipramine (primary metabolite or imipramine) and a corresponding reduction in the level of the subsequently formed metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine.
Amiodarone-cyclosporine interaction in a heart transplant patient.
This interaction necessitated a significant dosage reduction to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range.
To investigate the mechanism of the interaction, a cyclosporine-lipoprotein-binding determination was performed.
The results suggest that drug displacement from competitive lipoprotein-binding sites is not responsible for the alterations in cyclosporine pharmacokinetics.
clearance data suggests, however, that the primary mechanism for the interaction is the inhibition cyclosporine metabolism by the cytochrome P-450 system.
This report emphasizes the importance of reevaluating therapeutic drug regimens when new agents are added to prevent complications caused by drug interactions.
If amiodarone and cyclosporine must be used concomitantly, cyclosporine levels must be monitored frequently, in anticipation of this interaction.
We report the case of a heart transplant patient whose cyclosporine clearance decreased by more than 50% after the institution of amiodarone therapy.
Stereoselective genetically-determined interaction between chronic flecainide and quinidine in patients with arrhythmias.
1.
Recent reports have indicated a role for the P450IID6 polymorphism in the stereoselective disposition of single doses of the antiarrhythmic flecainide.
2.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of adding low dose quinidine, a potent inhibitor of P450IID6, to chronic flecainide therapy in patients with arrhythmias.
3.
This change was attributable to a decrease in metabolic clearance, was accompanied by decreased formation of the two major metabolites of flecainide and was not observed in a poor metabolizer subject.
The renal clearance of R-(-)-flecainide rose significantly.
4.
5.
The pharmacologic effects of flecainide therapy (QRS widening, % arrhythmia suppression) were slightly, but not significantly, increased.
6.
In extensive metabolizer patients receiving chronic flecainide, increased plasma concentration will develop if P450IID6 is inhibited.
In five extensive metabolizer patients, quinidine significantly reduced the clearance of R-(-)-flecainide, from 395 +/- 121 (s.d.) to 335 +/- 88 ml min-1.
Quinidine did not alter the clearance of S-(+)-flecainide.
